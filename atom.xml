Initially only for select iPhone models, the repair option will be available to more devices later on, though Apple did not clarify which models. The used components must be genuine Apple parts, in accordance with Apple’s efforts to minimize privacy and security concerns. </p><p>“For the last two years, teams across Apple have been innovating on product design and manufacturing to support repairs with used Apple parts that won’t compromise users’ safety, security, or privacy,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering, in the announcement. “With this latest expansion to our repair program, we’re excited to be adding even more choice and convenience for our customers, while helping to extend the life of our products and their parts.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-warns-of-mercenary-spyware-attacks-against-iphone-users-should-you-be-worried/" >Apple warns of mercenary spyware attacks against iPhone users. Should you be worried? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Repairers will be able to use pre-owned parts in phone fixes after “pairing,” or vetting, whether they are genuine Apple tech. Fixed phones will then be calibrated to original factory standards to ensure security and preserve device integrity, according to Apple.</p><p>The release, somewhat unclear, seems to include biometric sensors as used parts that can be recalibrated once installed in a device, but also says future iPhone models will support reused biometric sensors. Serial numbers won’t be required when ordering parts for certain repairs from the Self Service Repair store. </p><p>The new initiative expands Apple’s repair program to encourage safe and affordable device repairs, as well as product longevity and a reduced <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-modular-android-phone-will-outlive-the-latest-iphones-and-pixels-but-theres-a-catch/" >environmental footprint <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>“At Apple, we’re always looking for new ways to deliver the best possible experience for our customers while reducing the impact we have on the planet, and a key part of that means designing products that last,” Ternus added. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-new-airpower-video-is-out-but-is-apple-actually-reviving-its-qi-wireless-charging-mat/" >A new AirPower video is out, but is Apple actually reviving its Qi wireless charging mat? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>To maintain transparency about repair history and deter disassembly of stolen phones, Apple will extend Activation Lock to iPhone parts to alert those repairing the device if the parts have been reported lost or stolen. If they are, repairers will restrict calibration. Similarly, the company will update the Parts and Service History in iOS to indicate whether a part is new or used in the iPhone’s Settings. </p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?

There is currently no support for Wear OS, Polar, or Coros watches.</li></ul><hr><p>I am a very competitive person and enjoy expressing this trait in athletics. Smartwatches and sports watches adorn both of my wrists so that I can capture my health and fitness data in an attempt to stay fit. I also subscribe to Strava, in part due to Strava Live Segments and the potential to earn Local Legend status when I run.</p><p>To track my running activities, I lift my wrist and glance at my watch, while sometimes having to scroll to view all the metrics I am interested in. When biking, I have a bike computer in front of me on the handlebars, and I glance down to view the data while sometimes using a finger to scroll to other metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >The best Apple Watches you can buy: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://engoeyewear.com/products/engo-2-photochromic" >ZDNET RECOMMENDS Engo 2 Photochromic glasses The Engo 2 Photochromic lenses function as clear and tinted glasses with a heads-up display showing your most important workout data so you can focus on the activity. View at Engo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For the past several weeks, I’ve been running, biking, walking, and hiking with a pair of <a class="link"   href="https://engoeyewear.com/products/engo-2-photochromic" >Engo 2 Photochromic glasses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have significantly improved my outdoor exercise experience. These are exactly the type of lenses that I have wanted for years, as they provide me with a crystal clear heads-up display so that I never have to glance down at my watch or bike computer again.</p><p>Not only do the glasses provide key metrics for the activity that I am participating in, but when the ActiveLook software is powering the display from the Apple Watch Ultra 2, I am presented with a unique <a class="link"   href="https://engoeyewear.com/pages/sls" >Strava Live Segment view <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The Engo 2 Photochromic glasses optimize the Strava experience, motivating me to work harder to PR on segments and earn more Local Legend awards.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>In the ActiveLook software on your Apple Watch, you can select to view starred segments and those located around you to race against your own PR, other record holders, the carrot (your friend just ahead of you on the leaderboard), and the wolf (your friend that is just behind you on the leaderboard).</p><p>My time and distance behind the selected element appear on a visual arc over the top of other key metrics. These glasses make Strava a better real-time experience, so you don’t have to record data on the watch and then view it later at home after a shower.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The glasses are light at 36 grams and extremely comfortable. Still, it takes a bit of practice to get used to the large modules in the center of the glasses that house the battery, lenses, and sensors.</p><p>The display is located in the upper left corner of your right eye, just to the right of your nose bridge, so your focus bounces between it and the path ahead. I was able to get used to the view during my first run, but a bit is blocked by the hardware in the center of the glasses.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Speaking of sensors, the <a class="link"   href="https://engoeyewear.com/products/engo-2-photochromic" >Engo 2 Photochromic glasses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> support gestures. This is one of my favorite functions, since I can easily switch between the metrics that I set up in the app with a wave of my hand in front of the glasses.</p><p>The glasses show three lines of data on the heads-up display in a vibrant yellow&#x2F;orange color with clear fonts and three levels of brightness. You can customize what appears there using the ActiveLook smartphone app.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-garmin-watch/" >The best Garmin watches you can buy: Strong tracking tech for fitness, sleep, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If you run intervals or have complicated training plans, the Engo 2 lenses are even more valuable, since holding up your wrist and scrolling through screens on the run can distract you from the road ahead and slow you down. Seeing your key metrics served up in your view, including those from your Garmin watch loaded with the ActiveLook data field, lets you wear your watch or mount your bike computer and keep your eyes focused ahead of you.</p><p>Matthew Miller&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The battery provides up to 12 hours of data and the glasses are dust- and water-resistant, which means I can wear them all year long here in Puget Sound. I always wear glasses while biking, but rarely use them while running, and yet I have worn these for every run since they arrived.

Following Apple’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-releases-ios-17-5-heres-what-it-offers-and-why-you-should-update/" >iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 updates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, photos that users had deleted years earlier were resurfacing, even on devices that users had wiped clean.</p><p>Last week, Apple <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-17-5-1-patches-cringey-bug-that-was-resurrecting-old-deleted-photos/" >issued a patch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which the company said “provides important bug fixes and addresses a rare issue where photos that experienced database corruption could reappear in the Photos library even if they were deleted.” The bug only affected a small number of users and a small number of photos, Apple said, but for those users, it was pretty unsettling.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-transfer-data-from-android-to-an-iphone/" >How to transfer data from Android to an iPhone: 2 quick and simple ways <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>While Apple initially blamed the issue on “database corruption,” the company is now explaining more precisely what caused the problem.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/23/apple-deleted-photos-resurfacing-explanation/" >Speaking to 9to5Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Apple elaborated that the issue wasn’t with iCloud Photos, but with the databases on the devices themselves. In short, the restored photos were ones <em>not</em> synced to the cloud. When a device was restored from a backup – or from a device-to-device transfer – some of those photos were restored as well (from the device backup, not from iCloud). </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to make sure your deleted photos are truly gone, here’s what Apple recommends you do. (Note: This is only for times when you want to wipe a device clean of everything.) Under Settings, head to General, and then “Transfer or Reset.” You’ll see an option to “Erase All Content and Settings.” Tap that, and everything on your phone will be deleted, with no chance of your data coming back in the future.</p><p>Apple says that the once-deleted, now-resurrected photos will not automatically be deleted again. You’ll need to manually go in and remove them yourself.</p><h4 id="See-also"><a href="#See-also" class="headerlink" title="See also"></a>See also</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-envy-five-ios-17-features-that-android-users-already-have/"  title="iPhone envy?

It is, without a doubt, the device I use the most.

Even my long-time bugbear with Apple device’s, battery life, has improved to the point that I rarely have to think about it. So much so that to preserve the longevity of my battery, I only <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-turn-on-80-charging-limit-on-the-iphone-15-to-save-battery-health/" >charge my iPhone to 80% every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Even that reduced charge gets me a full day’s use.</p><p>That said, I detest one feature Apple introduced with the iPhone 15 – the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-the-iphone-15-pros-new-action-button-to-do-just-about-anything/" >Action Button <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the side. I don’t understand the logic behind this button. At a time when Apple is stripping buttons and ports out of devices to simplify them (and simplify the production line, which in turn boosts profits), it’s strange that users have gained a new button.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-rumored-ios-18-features-im-most-excited-about-and-ai-is-just-the-start/" >5 rumored iOS 18 features I’m most excited about - and AI is just the start <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The origin of this button traces back to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-spent-a-week-with-the-apple-watch-ultra-2-and-heres-what-stood-out-the-most/" >Apple Watch Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On the face of it, a button that can be configured to carry out a specific action sounds like a good idea. On the Apple Watch, this button is reasonable because you’re dealing with a device with limited screen real estate for on-screen buttons.</p><p>On the iPhone, however, this button feels strangely superfluous. Initially, I thought it would be a cool idea to set the button to activate the flashlight. Yes, a button on the screen allows you to turn the flashlight on, even if the phone is locked, but I thought I’d like a physical button.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Well, I’ve lost count of the number of times that the flashlight has accidentally activated itself while the phone was in my pocket or bag. Despite requiring a double press, it’s easy to activate.</p><p>While it’s frustrating to walk around with a flashlight switched on in your pocket, having it accidentally activate the camera and take hundreds of photos of the inside of your pocket is even more annoying. When I set the Action Button to do something less demonstrative – activate silent mode or do not disturb, for example – my phone is regularly silenced or set to do not disturb mode because of accidental activation.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-reports-spatial-video-and-ultra-thin-bezels-coming-to-all-models/" >iPhone 16 reports: Spatial video and ultra thin bezels coming to all models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Try as I might to love the Action Button, I can’t get to grips with it. The more I speak to other iPhone users, the more I hear the same thing. It’s a good idea, but poorly implemented.</p><p>I gave up, set the button to do nothing, and, much like the human appendix, it’s now a vestigial organ. At least this way, it can’t cause chaos.</p><p>You can change what the button does, and thankfully, you can also turn it off.</p><p>June Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>So, why did the Action Button need to exist in the first place? I’ve spoken to several people, inside and outside of Apple, and I’m still unclear. Was the button a genuine attempt to add a useful feature to the iPhone, one of those features that lost meaning as the iPhone 15 project moved on? Or was it just a cheap and simple way to make the new iPhone visually different from the old device?</p><p>While Apple has been pushing all the cool <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/" >artificial intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> features it plans to roll into the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/im-an-android-user-but-these-three-iphone-16-features-would-win-me-over/" >iPhone 16 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, along with the inevitable processor and camera improvements that we’ve come to expect every year, I hope the engineers at Apple have figured out a way to make this feature more user-friendly. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apples-ai-advances-could-make-or-break-the-iphone-16/" >How Apple’s AI advances could make or break the iPhone 16 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Of course, they could remove it altogether, because I’m not sure why, in an age where we’re used to touchscreens and voice activation and all that good stuff, we need to have yet another button.</p><p>Just make Siri better, and the argument for an extra button becomes moot.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-recommending-the-standard-iphone-16-over-the-pro-this-year-and-im-not-alone/"  title="Why I&#39;m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I&#39;m not alone)">Why I’m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-onedrive-messing-with-your-files-how-to-get-your-windows-storage-under-control/"  title="Is OneDrive messing with your files?

We’re well into trackpad and mouse support in iPadOS, and the iPad lineup has never looked or worked more like a laptop. However, with only a single port on the Pro and Air, connecting multiple accessories to the tablet can be a chore. For example, if you’re using the iPad with a USB keyboard, you have to disconnect the keyboard if you want to transfer some files to an external SSD. </p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/" >The best iPads: Which model should you buy?

On top of USB-C support, the latest iPad Pro supports Thunderbolt. That means you can take advantage of faster transfer speeds and connect Thunderbolt monitors directly to the tablet. </p><p>There are several docks and hubs that make connecting multiple devices and accessories, including external monitors, to the iPad a breeze. Below you’ll find a mix of options from various companies at a wide range of price points that I’ve personally tested with the 2021 iPad Pro. </p><p>I specifically picked devices that would appeal to all types of iPad users, ranging from someone who just wants a couple of extra ports to someone who wants a dedicated workstation. </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZVKTP53/ref=asc_df_B07ZVKTP531726830000000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B07ZVKTP53&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cbc51e941-d590-4319-a45b-ea58af175af4%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Anker-USB-C-Hub-7-in-1"><a href="#Anker-USB-C-Hub-7-in-1" class="headerlink" title="Anker USB-C Hub 7-in-1"></a>Anker USB-C Hub 7-in-1</h2><h3 id="Best-iPad-accessory-overall"><a href="#Best-iPad-accessory-overall" class="headerlink" title="Best iPad accessory overall"></a>Best iPad accessory overall</h3><p>Anker’s USB-C 7-in-1 hub is the most affordable option of the group, but don’t discount its capabilities.

You’re paying a premium for an Apple product, however. There are only three ports on the AV Multiport Adapter: HDMI, USB-A, and USB-C. </p><p>The USB-A port works with external hard drives or accessories, while the USB-C port only acts as a power pass-through for charging your iPad (or MacBook). The HDMI port supports up to 4K at 60Hz for all iPad models and a limited selection of MacBook models. </p><p>I included Apple’s hub in the list simply because, if you’ve owned a MacBook after Apple switched to USB-C, odds are you also have one of these adapters. I want to highlight that it does indeed work with the iPad Pro or Air, and it does a good job at providing minimal connections. </p><p>It’s expensive for what it offers, but that’s usually the case with Apple accessories.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Also supports some MacBook models</li><li>Works with hard drives or can provide power</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Only three ports</li></ul><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FF3BDW5?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cbc51e941-d590-4319-a45b-ea58af175af4%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1676741-REG/caldigit%5F500916%5Fusb%5Fc%5Fsoho%5Fdock%5Fgen2.html/BI/23252/KBID/28790/SID/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp" >View now at B&amp;H Photo-Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="CalDigit-USB-C-Soho-Dock"><a href="#CalDigit-USB-C-Soho-Dock" class="headerlink" title="CalDigit USB-C Soho Dock"></a>CalDigit USB-C Soho Dock</h2><h3 id="Best-for-multitasking"><a href="#Best-for-multitasking" class="headerlink" title="Best for multitasking"></a>Best for multitasking</h3><p>For $10 more than Apple’s adapter, you can get the CalDigit USB-C Soho Dock. With a total of eight ports, you can connect random accessories and devices to your iPad without having to figure out what to unplug. </p><p>The total list of ports includes 1 x USB-C (10Gb&#x2F;s) that connects the dock to your iPad. There’s another USB-C port next to a standard USB port, both of which offer 10Gb&#x2F;s speeds, a full-size SD card port, and a microSD card port. When it comes to external displays, you have an HDMI port and a DisplayPort with 4K@60Hz with HDR support. Next to the display connections is another USB-C port that only serves as a 100W PD receptacle to power all of your USB devices and charge the tablet or computer attached to the dock. </p><p>Instead of lengthy housing, the Soho has a rectangular design with ports on three of four sides. It’s a unique design since most hubs (like the aforementioned Anker) have a similar design. At $80, the Soho isn’t overpriced and offers a wide range of connections and speeds. </p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Plenty of port options</li><li>Unique design</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>A more costly option</li></ul><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S7LVDC9?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cbc51e941-d590-4319-a45b-ea58af175af4%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="HyperDrive-Power-9-in-1"><a href="#HyperDrive-Power-9-in-1" class="headerlink" title="HyperDrive Power 9-in-1"></a>HyperDrive Power 9-in-1</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947750/11832" target="_top" id="947750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947750/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-for-audio-output"><a href="#Best-for-audio-output" class="headerlink" title="Best for audio output"></a>Best for audio output</h3><p>The HyperDrive Power 9-in-1 hub is near the high-end of the docks on this list – but for good reason. With nine total ports and a lengthy USB-C cable that connects to the iPad, you can connect almost anything to the HyperDrive. </p><p>The ports include 1 x Gigabit Ethernet, 1 x 4K@30Hz, 1 x microSD, 1 x SD card reader, 3 x USB-A (5Gbps), 1 x USB-C PD at 60W, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. </p><p>The headphone jack may be confusing at first glance, and I’ll admit even I was perplexed by it. Then I remembered that, whenever you’re using a dock or hub with the iPad, it automatically routes all audio through the HDMI connection. By connecting a speaker or a pair of headphones to the audio jack on the Power hub, you’re able to listen to system sounds or music. </p><p>For someone who needs more than one or two USB ports – and prefers a hardwired Ethernet connection – the HyperDrive Power is where it’s at. </p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Provides a hardwired Ethernet connection</li><li>Nine total ports</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Headphone jack can be confusing</li><li>Most expensive option on our list</li></ul><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VYLQS9F/ref=asc_df_B08VYLQS9F1726743600000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B08VYLQS9F&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cbc51e941-d590-4319-a45b-ea58af175af4%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857869/11832" target="_top" id="857869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857869/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TwelveSouth-HoverBar-Duo"><a href="#TwelveSouth-HoverBar-Duo" class="headerlink" title="TwelveSouth HoverBar Duo"></a>TwelveSouth HoverBar Duo</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983551">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983551.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983551">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983551.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983551%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983551/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-ergonomic-display-option"><a href="#Best-ergonomic-display-option" class="headerlink" title="Best ergonomic display option"></a>Best ergonomic display option</h3><p>While the HoverBar Duo isn’t a hub, it’s included in this list because it provides a way to use the iPad that mimics a desktop feel. </p><p>I’ve used the HoverBar Duo with my 12.9-inch iPad Pro and all of the hubs discussed here.

I used each dock or hub for several days, testing the ports, connections, and reliability of the accessory during my time using it. </p><p>At times, my iPad would be connected to an external display. Other times, the hub would only serve as a means to connect external storage and accessories to the tablet, without a display attached. </p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Buy this…</strong></th><th><strong>If you need…</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Anker 7-in-1 USB-C hub</td><td>An affordable hub for connecting devices to your iPad</td></tr><tr><td>Apple USB-C adapter</td><td>A USB hub for Apple brand loyalists</td></tr><tr><td>CalDigit USB-C Soho Dock</td><td>A hub for content creators</td></tr><tr><td>HyperDrive Power 9-in-1</td><td>A high-end USB hub with Gigabit Ethernet support</td></tr><tr><td>TwelveSouth HoverBar Duo</td><td>A way to use your iPad like a desktop monitor</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Which-iPad-accessory-is-right-for-you"><a href="#Which-iPad-accessory-is-right-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Which iPad accessory is right for you?"></a>Which iPad accessory is right for you?</h2><p>The type of hub you want or need for your iPad will depend on your budget and how you use the tablet. Something like the Studio Dock is clearly for someone who uses the iPad as a computer replacement and doesn’t mind paying a lot for it. It’s easily the most versatile gadget out of the group. </p><p>Whereas the Anker hub is for someone who doesn’t want to spend a lot on a hub and doesn’t mind that it lacks all of the bells and whistles. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137210/26400" target="_top" id="2137210">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137210" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137210/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-the-iPad-work-with-an-Ethernet-connection"><a href="#Will-the-iPad-work-with-an-Ethernet-connection" class="headerlink" title="Will the iPad work with an Ethernet connection?"></a>Will the iPad work with an Ethernet connection?</h2><p>The iPad doesn’t have an Ethernet connection. Apple’s tablet lineup does, however, support using Ethernet as a means to connect to the internet. In fact, you’ll even see a new option in the settings app when your iPad detects it’s using a wired connection. </p><h2 id="What-are-the-best-iPad-accessories-for-graphic-design"><a href="#What-are-the-best-iPad-accessories-for-graphic-design" class="headerlink" title="What are the best iPad accessories for graphic design?"></a>What are the best iPad accessories for graphic design?</h2><p>If you want to use your iPad for graphic design, I recommend two accessories: the CalDigit USB-C Soho Dock and the TwelveSouth HoverBar Duo. </p><p>The CalDigit dock allows you to connect a 4K display for real-time monitoring of your art or offload images from your digital camera with the SD card reader slots. It also features a 100W USB-C charging port to keep your mobile devices or even your laptop at full battery.</p><p>The TwelveSouth HoverBar Duo is an articulating arm that holds your iPad in either a vertical or horizontal position, allowing you to use it like you would a desktop monitor. It’s also a great option for more ergonomic digital art creation, since you can position your iPad to where it’s most comfortable to use.</p><h2 id="What-accessories-does-the-iPad-Pro-come-with"><a href="#What-accessories-does-the-iPad-Pro-come-with" class="headerlink" title="What accessories does the iPad Pro come with?"></a>What accessories does the iPad Pro come with?</h2><p>Unfortunately, the iPad Pro doesn’t come with any free accessories. But when configuring the tablet for your needs, you can choose some to add onto your purchase. You can get the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil for $129, the Magic Keyboard for $299, or the Smart Keyboard Folio for $179.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-must-have-iPad-accessory-for-students"><a href="#What-is-a-must-have-iPad-accessory-for-students" class="headerlink" title="What is a must-have iPad accessory for students?"></a>What is a must-have iPad accessory for students?</h2><p>Students would benefit most from the Anker 7-in-1 USB-C hub.

If you’re trying to decide, read on to learn why you should upgrade or why it may be worth holding off until the iPhone 17.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Features</strong></th><th><strong>iPhone 16 Pro</strong></th><th><strong>iPhone 14 Pro</strong></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Starting price</strong></td><td>$999</td><td>$800</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display</strong></td><td>6.3-in Super Retina XDR OLED</td><td>6.1-in Super Retina XDR OLED</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>199 g (7 oz)</td><td>206 g (7.3 oz)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Apple A18 Pro</td><td>Apple A16</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>8 GB</td><td>6GB</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</td><td>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Battery</strong></td><td>3,355 mAh</td><td>3,200 mAh</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Camera</strong></td><td>48MP Wide | 12MP Tele</td><td>48MP UW</td><td>12MP Selfie</td><td>48MP Wide | 12MP Tele</td><td>12MP UW</td><td>12MP Selfie</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-iPhone-16-Pro-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-iPhone-16-Pro-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the iPhone 16 Pro if…"></a>You should buy the iPhone 16 Pro if…</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136624/26400" target="_top" id="2136624">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136624" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136624/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-You-want-Apple-Intelligence"><a href="#1-You-want-Apple-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="1. You want Apple Intelligence"></a>1. You want Apple Intelligence</h3><p>Apple’s artificial intelligence push, aptly named Apple Intelligence, will be available over the coming months on the iPhone 16 lineup, but it’s not coming to the iPhone 14 Pro. Though the iPhone 14 Pro will get iOS 18, it’ll soon be short on AI features, rendering it outdated. If you’d like to stay up-to-date with the latest AI features or already use other AI tools in your day-to-day life, the iPhone 16 Pro is likely a worthy upgrade.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-hands-on/" >iPhone 16 Pro hands-on: My 3 favorite things about this ridiculously overpowered supercomputer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>To run smoothly, the Apple Intelligence features require an A17 chip or newer and at least 8GB of RAM, but the iPhone 14 Pro has the A16 chip and only 6GB of RAM. The iPhone 16 Pro features an A18 Pro chip and 8GB of RAM, making it a good device to run Apple’s AI features. </p><h3 id="2-You’d-like-to-get-your-hands-on-the-bigger-screen"><a href="#2-You’d-like-to-get-your-hands-on-the-bigger-screen" class="headerlink" title="2. You’d like to get your hands on the bigger screen"></a>2. You’d like to get your hands on the bigger screen</h3><p>Apple has thinned out the iPhone 16 Pro’s bezels to the bare minimum and stretched the Pro models’ displays to 6.3 and 6.9 inches for the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, respectively. This gives users more screen real estate to watch videos, play games, view and edit documents, and read shared screens on video conferences.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-which-iphone-should-you-buy-today/" >Every iPhone 16 model compared: Which iPhone should you buy today? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The larger smartphone also means that the iPhone 16 Pro has a larger battery than the 14 Pro, at 3,355 mAh compared to 3,200 mAh. But even without the welcome battery upgrade, the new Pro models support faster charging than ever. The iPhone 16 Pro supports 40W wired charging and 20W of MagSafe charging, so if you find the iPhone 14 Pro’s charging slow, it could be time to upgrade.</p><h3 id="3-You-love-taking-beautiful-photos"><a href="#3-You-love-taking-beautiful-photos" class="headerlink" title="3. You love taking beautiful photos"></a>3. You love taking beautiful photos</h3><p>The iPhone 16 Pro features some of the best camera enhancements, including the improved ultrawide camera. The UW camera moved to align with a larger, improved Sony sensor, so it’s going from a measly 12MP to 48MP. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-demoed-apples-standard-iphone-16-and-didnt-envy-the-pro-models-at-all/" >I demoed Apple’s standard iPhone 16 and didn’t envy the Pro models at all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If you love taking photos with your smartphone, the camera upgrades alone may be enough to upgrade to an iPhone 16 Pro. The optical zoom is now 5x, an upgrade from the iPhone 14 Pro’s 3x zoom. The iPhone 16 Pro will also feature Apple’s new capture button, which lets you control the camera with gestures, like moving your finger and tapping the touch-enabled button. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Pre-order the iPhone 16 Pro View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948881/19272" target="_top" id="1948881">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948881" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948881/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-should-buy-or-keep-the-iPhone-14-Pro-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-or-keep-the-iPhone-14-Pro-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy (or keep) the iPhone 14 Pro if…"></a>You should buy (or keep) the iPhone 14 Pro if…</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139118/17108" target="_top" id="2139118">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139118" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139118/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-You’d-rather-wait-for-bigger-upgrades"><a href="#1-You’d-rather-wait-for-bigger-upgrades" class="headerlink" title="1. You’d rather wait for bigger upgrades"></a>1. You’d rather wait for bigger upgrades</h3><p>Even with the Apple Intelligence features, the iPhone 16 seems to be an incremental design change rather than a revamp; the design and functionality aren’t a radical departure from the iPhone 14 Pro. If you’re content with the look, feel, and performance of your iPhone 14, getting the iPhone 16 Pro likely won’t feel like a huge upgrade, especially since many of the AI features will come months after you get the device.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-pro-packs-a-lot-more-innovation-for-the-same-price-as-last-year/" >iPhone 14 Pro review: More innovation for the same price as the iPhone 13 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/12/iphone-16-new-features-worth-the-wait/" >Rumors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suggest the iPhone 17 may feature more dramatic design and functionality updates, making it a worthwhile jump. Besides, upgrading after two generations can be costly, which brings me to my next point. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-You-just-finished-paying-it-off"><a href="#2-You-just-finished-paying-it-off" class="headerlink" title="2. You just finished paying it off"></a>2. You just finished paying it off</h3><p>One of the biggest reasons to hold off on an upgrade is financial. The iPhone 14 Pro started at $900 at launch, which isn’t pocket change. Most buyers choose a 12-, 18-, or 24-month financing option through a carrier or Apple on a new iPhone. If you’re one of them and just finished paying off your iPhone 14 Pro and feel like you’re not financially ready to commit to another payment plan, it may be worth passing on the new iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-just-gave-me-a-compelling-reason-to-buy-the-smaller-iphone-16-pro-over-the-max-this-year/" >Apple just gave me a compelling reason to buy the smaller iPhone 16 Pro over the Max this year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>As an iPhone 14 Pro Max user, I’m still pretty happy with how my iPhone performs, its battery life, and charging time. While USB-C charging would be convenient, I don’t see myself springing for the new iPhone 16 Pro, though I may go for the iPhone 17 when it’s launched.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BN95FRW9?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C6842d6dc-9601-4f10-bd9f-091b511837bb%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >iPhone 14 Pro (Pre-owned) $627.45 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-consider"><a href="#Alternatives-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to consider"></a>Alternatives to consider</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-15-pro-128gb-natural-titanium-verizon/6525473.p?skuId=6525473&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >BEST iPHONE ALTERNATIVE iPhone 15 Pro While the iPhone 15 Pro is a year old, it will also support Apple Intelligence and starts at $900.

It’s easily my favorite smartwatch, and there are six reasons why.</p><p>(By the way, these reasons apply to all Apple Watches, whether it’s a <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminum-Detection/dp/B0CHX2F5NJ/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cd68bc2ab-4b95-4dbb-8461-3abb4a46ecac%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >baseline SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cellular-Smartwatch-Precision-Extra-Long/dp/B0CSVCDCPP?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cd68bc2ab-4b95-4dbb-8461-3abb4a46ecac%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >fancy new Ultra 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.)</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-A-less-distracting-extension-of-your-iPhone"><a href="#1-A-less-distracting-extension-of-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. A less-distracting extension of your iPhone"></a>1. A less-distracting extension of your iPhone</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>When making this list, I didn’t expect to make this aspect of the Apple Watch my number one reason for using the device. The Apple Watch, when connected to a cellular plan, is an extension of your iPhone. It integrates all the core services of your iPhone and leaves you feeling connected, even when you don’t have your phone on you.</p><p>Here’s a great example: when I took a mini vacation in Florida this past March, I would leave my iPhone in random places, whether in my bedroom, at a table by the pool, or on a towel at the beach. Then, I’d roam around with my Apple Watch and enjoy whatever I was doing, knowing I wouldn’t miss an important text or email.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-set-up-an-apple-watch/" >How to set up an Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>This benefit was especially true on the beach. My brother and I ventured out into the water to toss a frisbee (about knee-high, mind you) and I didn’t want to risk dropping my phone into the gulf, so I left it on the shore and relied on my Apple Watch to deliver notifications, texts, phone calls, and more.</p><p>The watch is also a great way to reduce distractions. When you have your phone on you, the temptation to “open Instagram quickly to see what’s going on” is real. An Apple Watch can’t entertain those same temptations and limits what you can do. Those restrictions may be inconvenient, but it’s also freeing. I love walking around with my watch on instead of carrying my phone, knowing I’ll eventually check the non-important apps on my phone while staying current with what’s really important.</p><p>Of course, your mileage may vary with this experience. Not everyone has or wants a cellular-connected Apple Watch, and all the dings and buzzes you get during the day can be distracting. But for me, having the watch strapped to my wrist and paired with my phone number makes it incredibly easy to cut the reliance on my phone and reduce the temptation to get carried away with all the apps I have installed. It’s great.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918698/19272" target="_top" id="1918698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-A-truly-great-fitness-tracking-experience"><a href="#2-A-truly-great-fitness-tracking-experience" class="headerlink" title="2. A truly great fitness-tracking experience"></a>2. A truly great fitness-tracking experience</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>As I said, I’ve used a lot of smartwatches, so I have a good grasp on what it’s like tracking your fitness with different platforms, and I’ve got to give it to Apple – they have one of the best.</p><p>From the concept of “closing your rings” every day (and the various awards you can earn), to starting fitness competitions with friends and comparing your data, using the Apple Watch and Apple Health for fitness tracking is fun and informative. Plus, all the various sensors built into the Apple Watch help to collect a lot of information about your health and progress.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2/"><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 vs Ultra 2: Which smartwatch should you buy?</strong></a></p><p>Apple’s platform isn’t perfect, mind you. You’ll find better sleep-tracking information on other watches, like the Google Pixel Watch 2, you don’t get any recovery information <em>at all</em>, and the Health app doesn’t proactively tell you whether you’re improving during your fitness journey. Still, for general consumers and fitness enthusiasts, using the Apple Watch for health tracking is a fantastic experience.</p><h2 id="3-Notifications-you-want-to-interact-with"><a href="#3-Notifications-you-want-to-interact-with" class="headerlink" title="3. Notifications you want to interact with"></a>3. Notifications you want to interact with</h2><p>I can’t tell you how many times I’ve used a smartwatch and wanted it to replicate the notification experience of the Apple Watch. From how alerts pop up on your wrist to the sounds and vibrations they make, everyone else should copy what Apple is doing.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-fall-detection-how-and-why-to-enable-it/" >Apple Watch Fall Detection: How and why to enable it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Seriously, the Apple Watch’s notification system is excellent. A gentle tap on the wrist lets you know something has just popped up, while the animation from app icon to notification is fast and clear. You can swipe the alert away with minimal effort, the notification shade is tight yet descriptive, and any notification you dismiss is also dismissed from your phone (a synchronization many Android phones don’t have when paired with a smartwatch). The Apple Watch has the best notifications in the game, bar none.</p><h2 id="4-The-greatest-haptics-on-any-watch"><a href="#4-The-greatest-haptics-on-any-watch" class="headerlink" title="4. The greatest haptics on any watch"></a>4. The greatest haptics on any watch</h2><p>Jason Hiner&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>One reason notifications are so good is the Apple Watch’s Taptic Engine, which delivers the most precise haptics on any smartwatch. Apple-engineered lighter vibrations feel like someone’s tapping you on the wrist, while longer buzzes are perfect for alarms and phone calls to grab your attention. Other watches are starting to get kind of close to the Apple Watch’s quality, but Apple still has a huge lead.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/" >Apple Watch Series 9 review: Why I’m not settling for the less expensive models in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The feel of haptics on a watch can set the tone for how you perceive the quality of the device. My <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Withings-ScanWatch-Light-Smartwatch-Monitoring/dp/B0CG9RZFLN/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cd68bc2ab-4b95-4dbb-8461-3abb4a46ecac%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >ScanWatch from Withings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, for example, buzzes like a cheap cell phone from 2014.

The Apple Watch’s haptics feel the most natural by far, which makes the watch feel great to wear by extension.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137221/26400" target="_top" id="2137221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137221/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Navigating-with-Apple-Maps"><a href="#5-Navigating-with-Apple-Maps" class="headerlink" title="5. Navigating with Apple Maps"></a>5. Navigating with Apple Maps</h2><p>Can you use other smartwatches to navigate to a new destination? You absolutely can. Am I unjustifiably biased towards the Apple Watch for having my favorite navigation experience? Yes, I am.</p><p>So, what makes navigating with Apple Maps on my Apple Watch so good? I like Siri’s more pleasant approach to dictating directions over Google Assistant’s, I enjoy the unique haptics the watch gives you when it’s time to turn left or right (did you know there’s a difference between the two?), I like the layout of the turn-by-turn directions on the watch, and it feels smoother (almost elegant) to use Apple Maps compared to Google Maps.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-maps-vs-google-maps/" >Apple Maps vs. Google Maps, which is best? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If I’m going somewhere I’ve never been, I wear my Apple Watch simply for the navigation perks. Yes, you’ll find a similar experience on other smartwatch platforms, but I like Apple’s the most.

It’s fast, fluid, easy to use, and has a huge library of third-party apps. The watch faces are simple, clean, and informative, while the new Smart Stack in watchOS 10 is great for quickly glancing at upcoming appointments, the weather, and more.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >The best Apple Watches: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The platform just works the way you’d expect. When paired to your iPhone, so many of your settings will sync with your Apple Watch that it’ll feel like you’ve customized the device without diving into settings. App notifications, Focus modes, Wi-Fi networks, and more all sync with your watch automatically, allowing you to hit the ground running when you strap your Apple Watch to your wrist.</p><p>When I have to test a new Wear OS watch, I immediately miss using watchOS. It feels clunkier and slower, the watch faces aren’t as nice (although there are some decent third-party options), and the apps aren’t as good. If you want the best smartwatch software experience and have to ditch your Android phone for an iPhone, making that switch is worth it. I have friends who have switched to the iPhone simply because the Apple Watch and watchOS are so good.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135406/19272" target="_top" id="2135406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bottom-line"><a href="#Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom line"></a>Bottom line</h2><p>While the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminum-Fitness/dp/B0CSVCD314/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cd68bc2ab-4b95-4dbb-8461-3abb4a46ecac%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> isn’t a perfect smartwatch, many qualities keep me using it.

Just like iPhones and cases, Apple Watches can be upgraded and customized for many situations, from casual to dressy, thanks to their interchangeable watch bands. </p><p>I’ve been an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> user for a few years now, and I recently upgraded from a Series 3 watch to the latest <a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Sleep-Tracker-Crash-Detection-Heart-Rate-Monitor/5033741510?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Watch SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Over the last several months, I’ve embarked on a journey to test Apple Watch bands from brands like Apple, Nomad, Spigen, and more, to find the best watch bands made of materials ranging from stainless steel to fabric to leather. I’ve also included input from other ZDNET experts who frequently try different watch bands and switch up their looks and consulted staff and customer reviews for bands across the market. Every pick on this list is backed by hands-on testing  staff. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/"><strong>The best Apple Watches you can buy</strong></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What’s-the-best-Apple-Watch-band-right-now"><a href="#What’s-the-best-Apple-Watch-band-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What’s the best Apple Watch band right now?"></a>What’s the best Apple Watch band right now?</h2><p>After months of wearing different bands during my daily activities and considering the rest of the ZDNET staff’s extensive hands-on analysis of watch bands, my pick for the best Apple Watch band overall is <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-band-black" >Nomad’s Sport Band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> thanks to its comfortable and breathable wear and its numerous color choices, including limited edition drops, for a nice upgrade over the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWMR3AM/A/41mm-soft-mint-sport-band-s-m?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >plain sports band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that came with my Apple Watch.</p><p>Not looking for a sport band pick?

It is designed for intense workouts and everyday wear. Plus, it’s 100% waterproof, so you can wear it as you exercise in rain, sleet, or snow without worrying about damage. Its lightweight design that encourages ventilation has also solved my sweaty gym wrists (if you know, you know). </p><p>If you’re looking to purchase a sport band or you love Nomad’s bands, we recommend keeping an eye on their website because the company regularly offers Limited Edition models with cool colors and styles (including the one pictured above on my Apple Watch SE). These historically sell out quickly, so if you see a limited edition offering, it’s smart to make your purchase quickly.</p><p>I tested the Nomad Sport band in the limited edition glow-in-the-dark Glow 2.0 design, and I was impressed with how similar it felt and performed to my original Apple sport band. Although not every sport band features this fun glow, they all offer the same features. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nomads-glow-in-the-dark-iphone-case-just-sold-out-but-its-alternatives-are-just-as-good/"><strong>Nomad’s glow-in-the-dark iPhone case just sold out, but its alternatives are just as good</strong></a></p><p>When I tested the Nomad sport band, I liked the durable yet comfortable material, the numerous color options available, the customizable adjustability, and the overall look of the band. Getting the band initially secured was a little difficult, but over time, I got it on and off quickly. It’s a nice upgrade from the standard Apple band, and should work for most people. Since it offers more notch options, it felt more secure on my wrist than the Apple sport band, and I felt it stayed cleaner than my Apple band typically does. </p><p>I only have two issues with this band. The first is that after a few weeks of wear, the coating on the stainless steel pin started coming off, although it isn’t noticeable unless I look very closely. Secondly, despite the numerous color options, I wish Nomad offered more, like some softer pastels.</p><p>Nomad sport band customers on <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16ldce5/are%5Fnomad%5Fstraps%5Fany%5Fgood/" >Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> said they liked the quality, color options (including limited edition designs), and overall value of the band. Some customers said the band did not sit flush with the Apple Watch Ultra, and one customer said the stainless steel pin broke off their band (although they reported customer service promptly replaced their purchase). </p><p><strong>Nomad Sport Band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Fluoroelastomer rubber | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch Ultra, Series 9, 8, 7, 6, SE, and all previous versions of Apple Watch | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 45mm&#x2F;49mm or 40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://burga.sjv.io/c/159047/1270603/15631?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%253A%252F%252Fus.burga.com%252Fproducts%252Fall-eyes-on-me-apple-watch-band&subId1=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Burga <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Two-tone design</li><li>Similar feel to jewelry watch</li><li>Clasp closure</li><li>Affordable luxury</li><li>Adjustable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Clasp can sometimes clip skin</li><li>Requires careful wear&#x2F;proper care</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130871/7443" target="_top" id="2130871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Burga-Stainless-Steel-Two-Tone-Apple-Watch-Band"><a href="#Burga-Stainless-Steel-Two-Tone-Apple-Watch-Band" class="headerlink" title="Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch Band"></a>Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch Band</h2><h3 id="Best-metal-Apple-Watch-band-for-style"><a href="#Best-metal-Apple-Watch-band-for-style" class="headerlink" title="Best metal Apple Watch band for style"></a>Best metal Apple Watch band for style</h3><p>Since I began exploring Apple watch bands, I’ve been searching for one that I can use to dress up my everyday look. This Burga watch band offers a two-tone stainless steel strap and an easy clasp closure. The inside is designed for comfort, and the band can support everyday wear and tear.</p><p>When I tested this Burga watch over a few weeks, I was immediately impressed with its overall appearance. It looked expensive and of quality, echoing the same look as a non-smart watch. It has a nice weight, and it was easy to follow the adjustment instructions to fit it to my wrist. </p><p>Throughout testing, I received several compliments on this band – which doesn’t often happen despite the number of products I test through my work, and I was happy with the affordable luxury look it gave my Watch SE. I had no issues with tarnishing or chipping after my few weeks of wear, although I was careful around water, did not wear the band while applying lotion, makeup, or perfume, and used a jewelry cloth to wipe it down every few wears or so. I also did not wear this band during intense workouts, but it was fine during my casual walks, usually 3-5 miles daily. </p><p>With proper care, this watch band offers great value. It looks much more expensive than it is, and it is worth the money if you’re looking to switch up your look for a special occasion or a few times a week. It is slightly pricier than bands made of less expensive materials but significantly less expensive than titanium options. </p><p>Current Burga customers said they liked this watch band’s overall design and quality, with some saying it looks and feels like an affordable luxury. </p><p><strong>Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Stainless steel | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> No | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> All current Apple Watch models | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 42mm&#x2F;44mm&#x2F;45mm&#x2F;49mm or 38mm&#x2F;40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-slim-band-white-41mm" >View now at Nomad Goods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Durable</li><li>High quality</li><li>Interior ventilation</li><li>Slim profile</li><li>Good for small wrists</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Limited color options</li><li>Slight wear on stainless steel pin</li><li>A little pricey</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Nomad-Slim-Sport-Band"><a href="#Nomad-Slim-Sport-Band" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Slim Sport Band"></a>Nomad Slim Sport Band</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-slim-everyday-Apple-Watch-band"><a href="#Best-slim-everyday-Apple-Watch-band" class="headerlink" title="Best slim everyday Apple Watch band"></a>Best slim everyday Apple Watch band</h3><p>Nomad’s slim sport band is a thinner version of the brand’s sport band. Though it features a similar design, material, and overall feel, the slim band has a thinner construction and a smaller overall look on the wearer’s wrist. </p><p>Like the classic sport band, the slim band is 100% waterproof, features a lightweight design that encourages ventilation, and is made of the same durable material. I was able to test the slim sport band for several weeks with my Apple Watch SE in starlight, and I liked how similar in color and feel it was to the Apple-issue sport band that came with my watch. </p><p>When I tested the band, I was also impressed with how secure the stainless steel pin kept the watch despite its more delicate profile. I prefer the slim band over Nomad’s classic sport band for everyday wear, though I can understand why this style may not be the best for someone with larger wrists or a desire for a more prominent watch band. </p><p>Like the sport band, it was a little tough to put on at first, but it became easier to do so the more I wore it. I have also seen some chipping on the stainless steel pin’s coating, and like with the sport band, I wish there were more color options. Since the slim band is my preferred style, it’s a bit of a disappointment that there are only four color options, especially when the larger sport band has quite a bit more and limited edition offerings. I’d love to see more punchy colors and some soft pastels in the slim band – it’s a great option for often smaller women’s wrists. </p><p>Regardless of my feelings about the color selection, I enjoyed testing the slim band, and since then, I’ve been frequently wearing it in my daily activities. </p><p><strong>Nomad Slim Sport Band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Fluoroelastomer rubber | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch Ultra, Series 9, 8, 7, 6, SE, and all previous versions of Apple Watch <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 45mm&#x2F;49mm or 40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.spigen.com/products/apple-watch-series-band-liquid-crystal-pro" >View now at Spigen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Crytal-Designed-Crystal/dp/B098SX92FT?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cf0300b26-d54a-40e5-8724-565f7a12cb22%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Truly clear</li><li>Case and band combo</li><li>Easy to take on and off</li><li>Easy to insert watch</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Needs breaking in</li><li>Silicone not the most malleable</li></ul><h2 id="Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Pro-Apple-Watch-Case-and-Band"><a href="#Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Pro-Apple-Watch-Case-and-Band" class="headerlink" title="Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch Case and Band"></a>Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch Case and Band</h2><h3 id="Best-clear-Apple-Watch-case-and-band"><a href="#Best-clear-Apple-Watch-case-and-band" class="headerlink" title="Best clear Apple Watch case and band"></a>Best clear Apple Watch case and band</h3><p>Spigen’s Liquid Proband is both an Apple watch strap and a case in one. Simply pop in your Apple Watch and fasten it to your wrist – you don’t have to deal with sliding any bands in. The Liquid Pro is available in crystal clear and black space clear colors. </p><p>It is made of soft silicone for comfort, fastens with a traditional buckle, and features a unibody design. I wasn’t expecting to like this band and case combo as much as I did. While I don’t think I’d consider this for myself for everyday wear, this is a great option for kids thanks to its all-in-one approach or for those looking to minimize the appearance of their watch thanks to the crystal clear design. </p><p>When I tested this watch band over a few months, I liked how easy it was to pop my watch in and out of this case yet how secure it remained. I also liked that the built-in case provided extra protection around my watch. The watch band itself is pretty comfortable overall, though the silicone wasn’t extremely malleable and is still a bit stiff. I predict that over more daily wear, it will eventually contour more to one’s wrist, but it definitely needs breaking in. </p><p><strong>Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Silicone | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 40mm&#x2F;44mm&#x2F;45mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://www.nike.com/w/apple-watch-nike-sport-band-7dq6d" >View now at Nike <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUV53AM/A/45mm-midnight-sky-nike-sport-band-m-l&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Comfortable</li><li>Breathes well</li><li>Durable</li><li>Fun colors</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Dust and residue collect in the holes</li><li>Requires cleaning</li></ul><h2 id="Nike-Apple-Watch-Sport-Band"><a href="#Nike-Apple-Watch-Sport-Band" class="headerlink" title="Nike Apple Watch Sport Band"></a>Nike Apple Watch Sport Band</h2><h3 id="Best-classic-Apple-Watch-band-alternative"><a href="#Best-classic-Apple-Watch-band-alternative" class="headerlink" title="Best classic Apple Watch band alternative"></a>Best classic Apple Watch band alternative</h3><p>Nike’s flagship sports band is the athletic brand’s take on the classic Apple sports band.

Often, Apple Watch bands from third-party brands are sized according to the display size of your watch, such as 40mm, 45mm, 49mm, etc, but they are not necessarily your watch model. Some bands may also have wrist-size options, such as Apple’s flagship sport bands, which are S&#x2F;M and M&#x2F;L, but other options don’t specify wrist sizes (they ensure adjustability for a great fit). Be sure you know what band size and potentially what wrist size you need.</li><li><strong>Durability</strong>: A purchase is hardly worth it if your Apple Watch band breaks or cracks, so it’s important to consider the long-term durability while searching for watch bands. We don’t want you to waste your cash on cheap options, so we’ve tested the picks on this list before recommending them.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: As with other purchases, what you’re willing to spend is critical. Establishing a budget can help narrow down your search parameters and ensure you’re purchasing within your comfort range. Keep in mind that the material will often drive the cost of Apple Watch bands up. Several metal band options on this list, particularly the titanium options, are over $100.</li><li><strong>Comfort:</strong> If you’re purchasing a watch band, you might want it to be comfortable. When I tested watch bands over the last several months, I considered comfort on my own wrist before recommending anything on this list. Your watch band must be secure, too, especially if you’re using your watch during intense workouts or for heart rate monitoring.</li></ul><h2 id="How-did-we-test-these-best-Apple-Watch-bands"><a href="#How-did-we-test-these-best-Apple-Watch-bands" class="headerlink" title="How did we test these best Apple Watch bands?"></a>How did we test these best Apple Watch bands?</h2><p>We went hands-on with every Apple Watch band on this list before selecting and recommending our picks. I conducted hands-on testing over several months on over a dozen watch bands and incorporated even more analysis and hands-on testing  staff. </p><p>We spent time wearing these bands in our day-to-day lives, during work, errands, workouts, and more to get a feel for each band’s comfort, security, adjustability, and more – not just for a day or two, but over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for each product’s add-in value. Can you “add” this product into your life and benefit from its presence, or is it just another fad product that’s too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? </p><p>If we think another product is worth your money, we’ll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it’s for. </p><p>Plus, we routinely scour the web for new products worthy of testing, follow news on product rollouts and upgrades, and source the best deals. We know buying anything in the current economy is not just for your whims, and that’s why this list, as well as our other advice, is tailored to your needs, wants, and budget. Our picks are expert-tested and expert-vetted. </p><h2 id="How-do-I-know-what-size-Apple-Watch-band-to-buy"><a href="#How-do-I-know-what-size-Apple-Watch-band-to-buy" class="headerlink" title="How do I know what size Apple Watch band to buy?"></a>How do I know what size Apple Watch band to buy?</h2><p>Before buying the best Apple Watch band for your Apple Watch, you need to know which size to buy. If you are not sure, Apple provides a convenient <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/Catalog/US/Images/bxxd/size-guide%5FCA.pdf" >sizing template <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you can use to check sizing. However, most bands today from non-Apple brands are adjustable and customizable for fit, so the band size isn’t of consideration. I only needed to remove links for the metal options I tested the last few months – for every other band option, I could self-adjust easily. </p><p>The most important factor is to confirm that your Apple Watch works with your chosen band to ensure a seamless fit when putting the two together. This means if you have a 49mm watch, you want to look for a band that specifies that size. Essentially, just know what model and display size you purchased for your watch, and you’ll be okay. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-much-do-the-best-Apple-Watch-bands-cost"><a href="#How-much-do-the-best-Apple-Watch-bands-cost" class="headerlink" title="How much do the best Apple Watch bands cost?"></a>How much do the best Apple Watch bands cost?</h2><p>The cost of Apple Watch bands can run the gamut, ranging from around $30 to upwards of hundreds of dollars. Many metal bands can easily bring you into the hundreds – Nomad’s titanium band is a whopping $300, and iterations of Apple’s Milanese Loop can get pricey, too. However, most of the picks on this list are under $100 and sit comfortably between the $30-$80 range.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-different-Apple-Watch-bands-available-from-Apple"><a href="#What-are-the-different-Apple-Watch-bands-available-from-Apple" class="headerlink" title="What are the different Apple Watch bands available from Apple?"></a>What are the different Apple Watch bands available from Apple?</h2><p>Apple offers several band options that are included with its watches, some dependent on the model purchased.

The idea of two independent earbuds that stayed in sync, were easy to use, and had respectable battery life was considered nothing more than a dream. </p><p>Fast forward to 2021, and Apple’s AirPods have spurred the creation of completely wireless buds from nearly every major tech company – and even smaller ones. For its part, Apple has released the AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and, more recently, the 3rd generation AirPods. The newest model boasts a completely new design and new features that were once reserved for its more expensive AirPods. </p><p>At $179, the base model AirPods saw a small price increase, with Apple keeping the 2nd generation AirPods in the lineup at $129. </p><p><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Caa3ef441-a9e9-4ea2-9497-3481695a10b8%7Cdtp&dtb=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/2021/11/09/7f658c09-25b4-49fd-b36c-477add905a80/airpods-third-gen-2.jpg"                      alt="airpods-third-gen-2.jpg"                > Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) 4.5 &#x2F; 5  Very good</a> </p><h4 id="pros-and-cons"><a href="#pros-and-cons" class="headerlink" title="pros and cons"></a>pros and cons</h4><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Long battery life</li><li>Solid sound quality</li><li>Multiple charging options</li><li>Spatial Audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>No noise cancellation</li><li>Some will have an issue with the fit</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Caa3ef441-a9e9-4ea2-9497-3481695a10b8%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >$175 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="A-familiar-but-different-design"><a href="#A-familiar-but-different-design" class="headerlink" title="A familiar, but different design"></a>A familiar, but different design</h2><p>Left: Apple’s newest AirPods. Right: AirPods Pro</p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>Apple’s standard AirPods have had the same design since their debut in 2016, but rumors circulated for the last year that the 3rd generation AirPods would look more like the AirPods Pro. </p><p>Sure enough, when Apple finally announced the 2021 AirPods, they debuted with a brand new look. The stems that come out of each earbud are shorter, and the earbuds themselves have a slightly new shape. The AirPods lack any sort of replaceable ear tip, with Apple keeping the one-size-fits-all approach it’s taken with standard AirPods since their launch. </p><p>On each earbud is a new sensor that detects when it’s in contact with your skin, enabling features like auto-connect and auto-pause or play when you put them in or take them out of your ears. </p><p>The stems each have a force sensor embedded. Squeezing either one will do things like pause or play music, answer a call, or trigger Siri, Apple’s personal voice assistant. </p><p>The charging case also looks more like the AirPods Pro case – only smaller. There’s a single indicator light on the front of the case to let you know when it’s charging or in pairing mode. On the back of the case is a button that you’ll use to reset the AirPods or pair them to a non-Apple device. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943647/22993" target="_top" id="1943647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-wireless-earbuds/" >The best wireless earbuds With good earbuds, you can do everything from making calls when you’re on the move to listening to your favorite music to blocking out the world around you.

It’s the same magnetic charging tech that’s used in the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, where Apple uses magnets to line up the pad with the device and hold it in place while it wirelessly charges. </p><p>Another notable addition to the new AirPods is that both the case and the earbuds themselves are IPX4 rated for water and sweat resistance. That doesn’t mean they’re waterproof, but you shouldn’t worry if they get a little damp during a workout. </p><p>The biggest question most people have about the AirPods is whether or not they’ll fit in their ears. The second question is whether or not they’ll stay in their ears.</p><p>For me, the AirPods fit and stayed in without any issues. I’m not a runner, but walking around the block at a decent pace didn’t cause any issues with their fit. Admittedly, everyone’s ears are different, and this may not be the case for you. </p><p>My advice is to give these a try, even if the original AirPods gave you issues. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139115/17108" target="_top" id="2139115">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139115" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139115/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="More-than-improved-sound-quality-and-battery-life"><a href="#More-than-improved-sound-quality-and-battery-life" class="headerlink" title="More than improved sound quality and battery life"></a>More than improved sound quality and battery life</h2><p>AirPods on a MagSafe charging stand. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>Whenever any company, let alone Apple, releases a new product, the core features almost certainly are improved. For example, the new AirPods promise and deliver on sound quality and longer battery life. For me, there’s a more rounded sound to the 3rd generation AirPods compared to the 2nd generation AirPods; the newest ones appear to have the sound quality of the AirPods Pro. And battery life has gone up, with the new AirPods giving you six hours of listening time, up from five hours on the previous model. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-wireless-charger/"><strong>The best wireless chargers</strong></a></p><p>If you include the charging case in battery life estimates, the 3rd generation AirPods should net you about 30 hours of listening time, up from 24 hours. </p><p>There’s a catch to those battery life claims, though. That 30-hour max is if you use the AirPods with Spatial Audio turned off. Spatial Audio is new to the entry-level AirPods, and it’s a welcomed addition. Previously, Spatial Audio was something only the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max offered. </p><p>When turned on while you’re either watching a compatible video or streaming compatible audio through the Apple Music app, Spatial Audio creates a 3D audio experience that follows your head as you move it. For example, while listening to Post Malone’s song “Circles,” you can turn your head to the right or left, and the audio in your ears changes as you move. It leaves you with the impression that you’re listening to live music directly in front of you. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>Outside of the impact on battery life, the only downside to Spatial Audio is that not all music or videos in the various streaming apps are compatible. So one minute you can be listening to a track that fully supports Spatial Audio, only for the next track to lack support. It’s an odd experience going back and forth, but it’s not a dealbreaker by any means. </p><p>The new AirPods use the same H1 chip that Apple has used in previous AirPods, which enables features like quick pairing, easy device switching, extended range, and longer battery life. It also makes it possible to use the hands-free “Hey Siri” feature to send messages, get weather updates, and interact with the personal assistant just like you would on your iPhone or iPad. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/"><strong>Shopping for an iPhone? Here’s the right model for you</strong></a></p><p>One missing feature that might be a deal-breaker for some is the lack of active-noise cancellation (ANC). That means the 3rd generation AirPods also lack a transparency mode to let in some environmental sounds. For those who don’t consistently need or use ANC, it’s likely to be a non-issue. But during the last few weeks, I’ve found myself wishing they had ANC. Whether it’s blocking the background noise of my kids arguing over who gets the last piece of candy, or the <em>clickety-clack</em> of my mechanical keyboard that randomly gets on my nerves, ANC has become a feature I don’t want to go without. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1492813">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1492813.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1492813">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1492813.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1492813%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1492813/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bottom-line"><a href="#Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom line"></a>Bottom line</h2><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNet</p><p>The 3rd generation $179 AirPods are going to be a hit. Just like the original AirPods, they offer functionality that can’t be matched by the competition, although, many products now come close. </p><p>There’s a lot to like about the latest AirPods. MagSafe isn’t a groundbreaking addition, but it’s something I think most iPhone owners will find themselves using as they add MagSafe chargers to their home or office. The new design looks a lot like AirPods Pro, save for the lack of adaptability. That said, I haven’t had issues with fit or comfort. </p><p>Personally, I’ve missed active-noise cancelation that the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max offer. But most of my use is in a noisy environment where I’ve grown accustomed to background noise being non-existent. </p><p>If you’ve been holding out on upgrading your AirPods for something better, the 3rd generation model is certainly it. If you’re new to AirPods, I can’t think of a better way to start your wireless earbuds experience within Apple’s ecosystem.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-instructions-on-how-to-erase-your-yahoo-mail-account-for-good/"><u>Comprehensive Instructions on How to Erase Your Yahoo Mail Account for Good</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/discover-the-greatest-lgbt-movies-available-on-netflix-as-of-july-2024/"><u>Discover the Greatest LGBT Movies Available on Netflix as of July 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/eliminate-delay-in-chromecast-audio-streaming-with-simple-fixes/"><u>Eliminate Delay in Chromecast Audio Streaming with Simple Fixes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/emerging-us-antitrust-legislation-taming-giants-in-tech/"><u>Emerging US Antitrust Legislation: Taming Giants in Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-boosting-views-with-captivating-intros-filmed-in-imovie/"><u>In 2024, Boosting Views with Captivating Intros Filmed in iMovie</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-catch-or-beat-sleeping-snorlax-on-pokemon-go-for-oneplus-ace-2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Catch or Beat Sleeping Snorlax on Pokemon Go For OnePlus Ace 2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-seamless-integration-of-movies-and-animations-using-movie-maker/"><u>In 2024, Seamless Integration of Movies and Animations Using Movie Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-11-free-apps-to-check-imei-on-apple-iphone-13-mini-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 11 Free Apps to Check IMEI on Apple iPhone 13 mini</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-universal-unlock-pattern-for-realme-11-proplus-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Universal Unlock Pattern for Realme 11 Pro+</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/mastering-accessibility-how-to-insert-captions-in-instagrams-stories-feature/"><u>Mastering Accessibility: How to Insert Captions in Instagram's Stories Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/the-best-8-vpn-hardware-devices-reviewed-on-realme-narzo-60-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>The Best 8 VPN Hardware Devices Reviewed On Realme Narzo 60 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/what-to-do-when-you-encounter-a-missing-mfplatdll-error-message/"><u>What to Do When You Encounter a Missing mfplat.dll Error Message</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Apple has finally instituted USB-C ports on its devices, which means that you can use the same cable to charge all of your Apple devices – as long as they’re the newer ones. Apple’s switch to USB-C connector also means faster transfer speeds from your iPhone to your Mac.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-usb-c-and-wireless-chargers-and-accessories-for-iphone-15-pro/" >Best USB-C chargers and accessories for iPhone 15 Pro: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But Apple didn’t do away with the lightning port out of sheer innovation.

You want a more durable iPhone"></a>3. You want a more durable iPhone</h3><p>The iPhone 15 Pro does away with a surgical-grade stainless steel construction in favor of Grade 5 Titanium. This – along with other upgrades – factors into the price, which is why the iPhone 15 is more expensive than previous iPhone models. Titanium is harder to mold and form than aluminum and stainless steel, but it’s a better choice for devices, in part due to its low thermal conductivity.</p><p>Titanium is more heat resistant than steel, which could result in fewer instances of <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-overheating-do-this-first-to-prevent-damaging-the-battery/" >overheating iPhones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The new iPhone 15 Pro has an aluminum coating on the inside, below the titanium finish, which further helps with heat dissipation.</p><p>The titanium construction is also lighter while maintaining the same strength as steel. Greg “Joz” Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said during last year’s September launch event that this is the lightest Pro iPhone ever. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Buy the iPhone 15 Pro View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-iPhone-13-Pro-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-iPhone-13-Pro-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the iPhone 13 Pro if…"></a>You should buy the iPhone 13 Pro if…</h2><p>Sarah Tew&#x2F;CNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134242/18498" target="_top" id="2134242">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134242" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134242/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-You’re-shopping-on-a-budget"><a href="#1-You’re-shopping-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can get a renewed iPhone 13 Pro for <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Sierra/dp/B09LPB9SQH?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cdd60e232-bfe8-4518-b9c1-ee19ff966753%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >as low as $500 on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, unlocked for all major carriers.</p><p>The iPhone 15 Pro, in turn, starts at $999. Of course, it’s brand new, but if you just need a new phone and don’t mind skipping the bells and whistles of the latest model, it’s possible to save a few hundred dollars.</p><h3 id="2-You-prefer-a-SIM-card-over-e-SIM"><a href="#2-You-prefer-a-SIM-card-over-e-SIM" class="headerlink" title="2. You prefer a SIM card over e-SIM"></a>2. You prefer a SIM card over e-SIM</h3><p>Apple got rid of the slot for a physical SIM card with the iPhone 14 in 2022. Since then iPhones are activated with an electronic SIM or eSIM. Essentially, they are activated over the air by the carrier instead of using a physical card. This might not seem like a big deal and it may even seem convenient in a lot of cases but a lot of people still prefer a physical SIM card. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/buying-the-iphone-15-heres-how-your-carrier-is-handling-esim-transfers/" >Buying the iPhone 15? Here’s how your carrier is handling eSIM transfers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Having a phone with a physical SIM card makes it easy and convenient to switch between devices, especially in case of emergency. If my iPhone XS Max breaks down, for example, I’d be able to pop out the SIM card and put it in another backup phone I had in my home and still be able to use a phone while I either got mine fixed or got a new one. But if my iPhone 14 Pro Max breaks down I can’t take out the SIM card and put it in my old XS Max because it’s an eSIM.</p><h3 id="3-A-gold-iPhone-is-your-thing"><a href="#3-A-gold-iPhone-is-your-thing" class="headerlink" title="3. A gold iPhone is your thing"></a>3. A gold iPhone is your thing</h3><p>If you love a gold iPhone and were hoping to see the iPhone 15 Pro bathed in gold, I hate to be the bearer of bad news. The iPhone 14 was the last to get a gold color finish, which is another point in favor of the iPhone 13 Pro.</p><p>Even though I got a purple iPhone 14 Pro Max when it came out, I was a faithful gold iPhone user for years after Apple discontinued the rose gold finish. But if you want to get an iPhone 13 Pro and you love the gold iPhone, you’ll be glad to know that it is still available from resellers.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LPB9SQH/ref=asc_df_B09LPB9SQH1727262000000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B09LPB9SQH&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cdd60e232-bfe8-4518-b9c1-ee19ff966753%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Buy the iPhone 13 Pro $500.75 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-consider"><a href="#Alternatives-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to consider"></a>Alternatives to consider</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-128gb-deep-purple-verizon/6487406.p?skuId=6487406&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >BEST IPHONE ALTERNATIVE iPhone 14 Pro Launched in 2022, the iPhone 14 Pro is the first to feature the Dynamic Island at the top of the screen and Always-on display.

My kids are in middle and high school, with a college student in the mix as well. Our family has found different tech tools helpful at various points in their educational journeys.</em></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Must-Haves-Computers-Laptops-and-Peripherals"><a href="#Must-Haves-Computers-Laptops-and-Peripherals" class="headerlink" title="Must-Haves: Computers, Laptops and Peripherals"></a>Must-Haves: Computers, Laptops and Peripherals</h2><p> Does your child need a laptop or a desktop computer? It could be that they need both, plus accessories (known as peripherals) like mice, webcams, and headphones.</p><p> Laptops are great for letting kids work when they’re on a school bus, waiting for a ride, or hanging out anywhere there is a Wi-Fi connection. They don’t always have the same power and capabilities, however, that a desktop PC might. But for completing most middle- and high-school assignments, they should work just fine.</p><p> Some schools or districts provide students with Chromebooks free of charge; others don’t. On the other hand, college students are almost always expected to provide their own devices (like laptops or computers).</p><p> Depending on your child’s situation, you might need to budget this year for a new laptop or desktop computer, or you might be able to get away with adding just a few peripherals like a new mouse, webcam, or speakers.</p><p> Beware of school policies around Chromebook lending. In most cases, parents must sign releases indicating they will be responsible for anything that might happen to the device. That can put you on the hook for a spendy replacement or repair you might not be ready for. Schools do have other options they can give you, including requiring the student to keep the Chromebook at school or providing them with paper assignments instead.</p><p> The real trick is deciding what you need to buy. While it’s tempting to purchase the cheapest items, that can backfire because “inexpensive” sometimes translates into cheap materials that can’t withstand your child’s activities or the occasional tossed backpack. Less expensive devices may also lack the speed or power to do everything your student needs them to.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/editor-s-choice-the-best-tech-gifts-for-back-to-school-7692969" >Editor’s Choice: The Best Tech Gifts for Back To School <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5xqW8ViVbQNgb2VUsUblogbwFco=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(200000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Studentswithlaptopsondesksandbeanbags_skynesher_GettyImages-1456220436CROPPED-19c3059f597a4aa1b038835c96bacc75.jpg"                      alt="Students using laptops at tables and in bean bag chairs."                ></p><p>Skynesher&#x2F;Getty</p><p> For example, if your child is a STEM kid or a graphic artist, more power and storage are necessary overall.

It doesn’t have a phone.</p><p> In either case, you’re in luck. Since texting is so popular, there are a bunch of great free texting apps for iPhone and iPod Touch. These are especially great if you have a Touch because many assign you a “phone number” that you can use to send and receive texts, photos, and more.</p><p> These apps are free — so what’s the catch? Many of these free apps contain lots of ads, but that’s probably a small annoyance in exchange for unlimited texting (<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/in-app-purchase-4155822" >in-app purchases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> often remove ads and unlock additional features).

It also brought always-on capabilities and stand-by mode with the Pro models, followed by more customization options with iOS 17.

I spent about half of the year using both units. I had my Mint Mobile eSIM installed on the smaller iPhone 15 for the first three months and then transferred to the iPhone 15 Plus for the other half. A good part of my long-term evaluation process includes testing cellular connectivity (read: using the devices in crowded areas, on top of buildings, in subways, and more), day-to-day performance, and taking more photos than a standard free subscription to iCloud can contain.</p><p>The difference between the two latest iPhone handsets mainly boils down to display size and battery life; unlike the Pro models, there’s no camera hardware discrepancy, which means the general user experience of the two is pleasantly similar. That made my life as a phone reviewer a little easier – and makes the list below all the more applicable to both iPhone models.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123899/26106" target="_top" id="2123899">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123899" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123899/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-iPhone-15’s-best-features"><a href="#What-are-the-iPhone-15’s-best-features" class="headerlink" title="What are the iPhone 15’s best features?"></a>What are the iPhone 15’s best features?</h2><p><strong>Thinner, lighter form factor:</strong> Without question, the most important aspect of a phone is how it feels in hand – we carry these things around everywhere, all the time – and with the latest iPhone, it’s baffling how much more premium it feels compared to previous generations. Whether you’re coming from an iPhone XR or an iPhone 14, the glossy, sharp-cornered form factor of old pales compared to Apple’s new design language, which flaunts contoured edges and a color-infused, satin backing. Apple has always kept the matte finish exclusive to its Pro line, so I’m all for the iPhone 15 being a little more disruptive.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Less is more here, and Apple’s slimming down of the base-level iPhone has made it so comfortable in my hand that I didn’t – and still don’t – envy the Pro model’s titanium material one bit. The iPhone 15 also comes in more charming colors than the Pro line, with pastel – and emphasis on “pastel” – hues of green, yellow, pink, blue, and black. For me, matte black is king, easily matching my favorite (though flawed) <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/matte-black-iphone-7-paint-problems-if-its-finish-is-flaking-off-youre-not-alone/" >iPhone finish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all time.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Island:</strong> The most notable display upgrade with the iPhone 15 is the Dynamic Island, carried over from the previous year’s iPhone 14 Pro. (The brighter 2,000-nit display comes in a close second.) It’s a feature that everyone can appreciate – whether you end up using it or not – because, unlike the notch that it replaced, the Dynamic Island turns that chunk of previously unused real estate into a glanceable status indicator system. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-you-shouldnt-buy-the-iphone-16-for-apple-intelligence/" >Why you shouldn’t buy the iPhone 6 for Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>You don’t <em>have</em> to interact with the Spotify music player or Uber Eats tracker that magically morphs into the pill-shaped cutout to appreciate its functionality. If you do, though, you’ll be glad you no longer have to open an app just to skip a track or know how much further away your game-day pizzas are. I’ve enjoyed using the <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumy-beautiful-sun-tracker/id908905093" >Lumy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, which displays a timer for when golden hour ends, so I know exactly how long I have left to take those warm and dreamy photos before sunset.</p><p><strong>USB-C</strong> <strong>port:</strong> This one should be more straightforward than it seems, but Apple’s crisscrossing of <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-iphone-15s-usb-c-upgrade-may-have-serious-implications-for-the-charging-accessory-future/" >charging standards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and data transfer speeds means that it’s not. While the iPhone 15 now supports the universal USB-C port, meaning I no longer have to wrestle through my car’s center console for a Lightning cable or <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-usb-c-cables-for-the-iphone-15/" >USB cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> depending on what phone I’m using, it’s not as powerful and fast as the one on the iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p>The iPhone 15 can also charge other phones and accessories, including this SmallRig video light that I use when filming.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The result is a slower charging rate (up to 18W) and data transfer speed (up to 480Mbps), which I haven’t found to be deal-breakers. Part of the reason is that the iPhone 15 Plus, in particular, has been an absolute endurance beast, lasting me well into a second workday before needing to be charged. It even beats the iPhone 15 Pro Max’s battery life, as reported by numerous testers.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-ios-18-public-beta-is-available-for-iphone-right-now-heres-how-to-download-it-and-which-models-support-it/" >The iOS 18 public beta is available for iPhone right now. How to download it (and which models support it) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Naturally, I’ve been topping it up when I’m deep at work or cooking, when how quickly the phone charges is the least of my worries. (Second note: The smaller iPhone 15’s battery life has been less spectacular, netting me well under a day of usage.) I’ve also gotten so used to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/how-to-airdrop/" >using AirDrop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and cloud services for file transfers, especially for time-sensitive photos and videos captured at press events, that the slower data transfer speed is insignificant to my workflow. </p><p><strong>48-megapixel camera:</strong> Speaking of which, both the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a new 48MP main camera that defaults to 24MP capturing (by combining the low-light capabilities of a 12MP binned photo and the detail of the 48MP), and I was satisfied with its output. The iPhone’s color science leans more natural, prioritizing the finer details like subjects underneath shadows and how evenly lit everything in the frame is.</p><p>Here’s the Wythe Hotel captured with the iPhone 15 Plus’ 12-megapixel ultrawide lens.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The image above, when captured on a Samsung Galaxy S23 or a OnePlus 11, made the sky more blue, the trees unnaturally vibrant, and the traffic lights a more polarizing neon yellow. Of course, which camera output is better comes down to personal preference, and in some cases, I actually prefer the more processed but ready-to-share stills that I get from a competing <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-phone/" >Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-decluttered-my-iphone-and-freed-up-gigs-of-space-heres-how/" >I decluttered my iPhone and freed up gigs of space. Here’s how <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The iPhone 15’s 48MP camera can also function as a telephoto lens with a 2x zoom. Apple calls it a 2x “optical” zoom, but from what I’ve seen when comparing the optically zoomed photo to one I manually cropped in, the difference is negligible. As for low-light photography, I’m glad to see Apple embracing the darkness and not making an otherwise moody, sunsetting environment look like the middle of the day, as depicted below.</p><p>Tip: iOS 17 gives you a leveler in the camera app to help you frame and straighten photos just right.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>With the iPhone 15’s camera system, its video capabilities stand out to me the most. Of all the phones I’ve tested, nothing comes close to the raw output that I get from an iPhone camera, from the image stabilization that doesn’t make a buzzing effect every step that I take to how consistent colors are when switching between the main wide lens to the ultrawide.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027167/19272" target="_top" id="2027167">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027167" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027167/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-I-upgrade-from-my-older-iPhone"><a href="#Should-I-upgrade-from-my-older-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Should I upgrade from my older iPhone?"></a>Should I upgrade from my older iPhone?</h2><p>It’s true that <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-users-keep-their-phones-longer-than-android-owners/" >consumers are now upgrading their smartphones at a slower rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, spending three years or more with their devices before switching to the next best thing.

Not everyone will notice the difference between a 60Hz panel and a 120Hz panel, but as someone who carries a secondary Android phone at all times, it’s hard not to acknowledge the less fluid iPhone display. This may also be a dealbreaker if you’re upgrading from an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro and have gotten used to the Pro Motion panels.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-uncovered-8-cool-ways-to-use-lidar-on-an-iphone-and-ipad/" >I uncovered 8 cool ways to use LiDAR on an iPhone and iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Is this Apple’s way of splitting up the non-Pro and Pro models? Probably. I don’t take for granted that fewer animations mean the iPhone 15 is more battery efficient than the Pro, but in a world where even sub-$200 phones have 120Hz displays, I really wish that Apple gave its $800 iPhone something smoother on the eyes.</p><p><strong>An Action button:</strong> Given how many iPhone 14 Pro features Apple carried over to the iPhone 15, I have my fingers crossed that Apple will replace the alert slider with the Action button this year. Over the course of testing the latest iPhones, I’ve used the alert slider less than a dozen times. An Action button would give the iPhone much more functionality.</p><h2 id="Final-thought"><a href="#Final-thought" class="headerlink" title="Final thought"></a>Final thought</h2><p>It’s easy to call the standard iPhone model the “Best iPhone for most people.” That’s been the case since Apple introduced a Pro variant with the iPhone 11 series, and still holds true with the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Only now, I’m finding myself recommending the non-Pro iPhone to more users than ever before, including folks I’ve known to be more demanding of their tech. Apple’s made just enough feature upgrades (and a few compromises that may be imperceivable to some) to help the latest iPhone model stand out, even when stacked against the generation before it.</p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-consider"><a href="#Alternatives-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to consider"></a>Alternatives to consider</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-14&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >BEST IPHONE 15 ALTERNATIVE Apple iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus Apple still sells the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, and with a $100 discount, so if you don’t need the latest features – and want to save yourself a Benjamin – they’re both viable alternatives.

Instead of a dongle that hangs off the TV, this one sits on a surface and uses dedicated power and data cables.

If you’re in the market for a dashcam, the Rexing V1 is definitely worth considering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JfL4E5NnuBPl6-93Hv3PI4IJsV0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_05-bcfff5f440b545378c9ee4e6b431ffac.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Fits-perfectly-on-your-windshield"><a href="#Design-Fits-perfectly-on-your-windshield" class="headerlink" title="Design: Fits perfectly on your windshield"></a><strong>Design: Fits perfectly on your windshield</strong></h2><p> The Rexing V1 Dashcam has a more distinctive form factor than other models we reviewed. Unlike many popular dashcam models, the V1 doesn’t resemble a point-and-shoot camera that hangs from your windshield. Rather, it’s angled to fit the curve of the glass. This makes for a more integrated, smooth look.</p><p> And it’s not just looks that make the design appealing. The fact that it’s not a simple square allows easier access to the control panel, improves the viewing angle of the display, and makes navigating the already-simple interface a bit easier.</p><p> There’s only one way to install this camera in your car, and that’s via a mount that sticks to your windshield with an adhesive strip. Fortunately, this works really well and the mount stays in place—throughout our testing, jolts and bumps on the road didn’t budge it. And once the camera was installed on our windshield, it was very easy to slide it on and off the mount.</p><p> Throughout our testing, jolts and bumps on the road didn’t budge it.</p><p> At just 2.7 inches, the display on this dash cam is the smallest among the devices we tested, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. All the icons, menus, and video footage itself are perfectly visible up close. And you probably don’t want to be paying attention to the screen while you’re behind the wheel, anyways—the at-a-glance view of the camera’s status is all you need.</p><p> It also has an internal accelerometer that can detect the impact of an accident, as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-gps-how-it-works-4688647" >GPS capabilities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with all the necessary equipment to use the GPS feature—if you want to enable these, you have to buy the<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Rexing-GPS-Logger-V1-V1P/dp/B01AKH377A/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4770571%7Cn9eae1cd5706347139b8b83241f9d42ea10%7C" >Rexing GPS Logger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> separately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ztn3EsFqtKkWImvQhtgcr1vlHwI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_02-9ee3aa46e7394a1ab263a6b12b287314.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Be-sure-that’s-where-you-want-to-put-it"><a href="#Setup-Process-Be-sure-that’s-where-you-want-to-put-it" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Be sure that’s where you want to put it"></a><strong>Setup Process: Be sure that’s where you want to put it</strong></h2><p> For those concerned about the hassle of installing a dashcam, don’t worry. The user manual for the Rexing V1 was the clearest and most detailed of all the dashcams we tested. The instructions are written in easy-to-understand language, and every button, feature, and tool is explained in detail so there’s no guesswork when you turn the device on.</p><p> Attaching this dash cam to your windshield is easy. Simply pull the plastic off the double-sided adhesive on the mount and stick it where you want it to go. However, you should be very careful when you’re doing this and make absolutely certain that you want it where you put it the first time. After a few seconds of being attached, it’s on there for good, and it takes a decent amount of ingenuity and elbow grease to get it off. Once it’s off, you can’t reapply it.</p><p> One of the things we appreciated about this dash cam is that it includes a 32GB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so you won’t have to put out extra cash to get one. However, there is no microSD card adapter, so if you want to review your footage on a computer you’ll have to buy one of those.</p><p> Also included in the box is a special tool that helps you hide the power cable. To prevent the wire from hanging down in front of your windshield, you need to wedge it up under the edge of the roof and through the side panels (the instruction manual shows you the best route to take). It may seem complicated at first, but this whole process only took us about ten minutes to accomplish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/df0_L-UzAk3OryqSCncsjfqi8QM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_03-2273fff3f71944368711b60f5da9687e.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151856/7443" target="_top" id="2151856">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151856" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151856/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886048/19272" target="_top" id="1886048">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886048" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886048/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Basic"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Basic" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Basic"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Basic</strong></h2><p> You can set this dash-mounted camera to capture footage in either 720p or 1080p resolution, which is pretty limited. Similar dashcams can capture footage up to 2560 x 1440 resolution, with others going all the way up to 4K. However, if all you’re looking for is a simple security device, 1080p will do just fine.</p><p> When we reviewed the footage captured by the Rexing V1, we found it to be highly detailed and clear when the car was moving along city streets. However, when we hit the freeway, the picture became a little less clear. Signs were hard to read unless you stopped the recording, and small details such as license plates and bumper stickers on other cars couldn’t be made out at all. Nevertheless, the videos yield a good picture of what happens when you drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9_1pHoEq74JWPJ8reothv8PeI8E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4062264_04-c5d42af8ddfa4296a6c6b1e8551edef6.jpg"                      alt="Rexing V1 DashCam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1976998">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1976998.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1976998">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1976998.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1976998%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1976998/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Performance-Set-it-and-forget-it"><a href="#Performance-Set-it-and-forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Set it and forget it"></a><strong>Performance: Set it and forget it</strong></h2><p> During our testing, we took the Rexing V1 on several lengthy drives through the cities and countryside of northern Utah. In the week that we had it, we never had a problem with how it functioned. It stayed firmly attached to the windshield, powered on every time we turned the ignition and never missed a frame while we were driving. This is one of those devices that embodies the “set it and forget it” mentality.</p><p> This dashcam uses loop recording, which means that it is continuously recording while your car is on, but splices it up into manageable bits rather than one long file. Rexing recommends setting this to three minutes, but you have options to set it to five- and ten-minute intervals as well. When your memory card fills up, the device automatically overwrites the oldest files.</p><p> It stayed firmly attached to the windshield, powered on every time we turned the ignition and never missed a frame while we were driving.</p><p> This dashcam is also equipped with an internal accelerometer that gives it the ability to detect a traffic accident. When it senses that an incident has occurred, it automatically locks the video for that time to prevent it from being overwritten. This is a common feature among the dash cams we tested, but it works well and is a great way to protect yourself if you ever need to prove what happened in an accident.</p><p> One feature that is unique to the Rexing V1 is time-lapse recording. It is turned off by default and Rexing recommends you keep it off for your day-to-day driving. But if you’re taking a road trip with scenic routes or want to record a particular journey, this feature is fun to have.</p><p> Like the rest of the dashboard cameras we tested, the Rexing V1 has the ability to record audio, but it does a middling job of it. Voices in the car and sounds coming from the interior speakers were clear enough to understand, but sounds from outside the vehicle were muddy at best.</p><h2 id="Price-A-good-value"><a href="#Price-A-good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: A good value"></a><strong>Price: A good value</strong></h2><p> The Rexing V1 retails for $130, but as of the time of this writing, can typically be purchased for closer to $100. We feel like this is a perfectly appropriate price for this device—it falls right in the middle of the typical dashcam price range, providing better performance than super budget models, but without the high-tech features of the more expensive options out there. In short, it’s a good price for a solid, basic device.</p><h2 id="Competition-Z3-Plus-vs-Rexing-V1"><a href="#Competition-Z3-Plus-vs-Rexing-V1" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Z3 Plus vs. Rexing V1"></a><strong>Competition: Z3 Plus vs. Rexing V1</strong></h2><p> If you’re wondering if you want to pay the extra $25 or so for the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam (which retails for $125), the decision will come down to form factor and image quality—everything else is pretty much the same.</p><p> The Z3 Plus is square and hangs from your windshield from a suction cup, so it can stick out like a sore thumb. The V1 doesn’t have that problem since it’s angled to fit your windshield, but the adhesive tape that holds it on is one-time-use only. If you make a mistake when installing it, you may end up wishing for the Z3’s clunky suction cup design.</p><p> If the Rexing V1’s 1080p resolution is good enough for you, there’s no need to put down extra cash for more pixels. The video is definitely high-res enough to use as a security device, and can effectively capture an accident or other incident. But if you want great video footage that you’ll enjoy watching in the future, an extra $25 isn’t too high a price to pay.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>It delivers on what it was designed to do, without any extras.</strong></p><p> There isn’t much to complain about with the Rexing V1 DashCam.
