## Overcoming Call Rejection Problems on Your Samsung Galaxy Watch - Easy Fixes and Tips
 One of the most important features of Samsung Galaxy Watches is that they allow you to answer calls without picking up your phone. If you can’t answer calls on a Samsung Galaxy Watch, there may be a connectivity problem, the watch may not be configured correctly, or you may need to add it to your mobile plan.

## How to Fix it When You Can’t Answer Calls on a Samsung Galaxy Watch

 Perform each of the following troubleshooting steps in the order presented (easiest to most involved) for your best chances of success.  

1. [Restart your Galaxy Watch](https://www.lifewire.com/restart-samsung-galaxy-watch-5217412) . Restarting will not delete anything, and it takes only a minute or so to finish up. It's a great first step for pretty much any tech problem.
2. [Confirm you've connected your Galaxy Watch to your phone](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-samsung-galaxy-watch-to-phone-5217958) . The phone and watch must be connected via Bluetooth. Without pairing your phone properly, you won't be able to answer calls.  
 Be sure you've enabled Bluetooth on your paired phone. Without Bluetooth on, you can't connect your watch and phone, and therefore can't answer calls.
3. Check that your watch is near your phone. If you don't have LTE, your devices must be close together for you to answer calls (within about 30 feet).  
 If you can answer calls when the watch and phone are really close, there may be radio interference in the area that's preventing a connection when they're further apart. That, or it's a problem with your phone’s Bluetooth radio.
4. [Turn on notifications on your Galaxy Watch](https://www.lifewire.com/receive-text-messages-on-samsung-galaxy-watch-5217923) . You may have inadvertently disabled notifications. In the Galaxy Wearable app on your phone, go to**Watch settings** \>**Notifications** , and ensure you've turned on call notifications.
5. [Verify that your watch has LTE service, if applicable](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fanswer%2FANS00082122%2F) . In the Galaxy Wearable go, go to**Watch settings** or**Home** \>**Mobile plans** . This option is only available if you’ve activated the watch with your cellphone carrier. If you haven’t done that yet, contact your carrier for more information.  
 If you have an LTE-enabled Galaxy Watch, you can answer calls without your phone once you purchase and activate a cellular plan for your watch.
6. [Change the watch band if it's metal](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fanswer%2FANS00087245%2F) . This material may cause interference, leading to disconnected calls.
7. [Check the Do Not Disturb settings on your phone](https://www.lifewire.com/use-do-not-disturb-on-android-4688870) . You can access the Goodnight, Bed Time, and Theater modes in the watch's Advanced or Quick settings. If any of these modes are on, turn them off and check to see if you can answer calls.
8. Check your phone’s Bluetooth connectivity. Try using your phone with other Bluetooth devices in various locations. If it works in some areas but not others, you’re probably dealing with interference.  
 If your phone has poor Bluetooth range wherever you go, you may need to repair or replace the phone.
9. [Check if Water Lock is on](https://www.lifewire.com/is-galaxy-watch-waterproof-4774452) . If you’ve accidentally turned on Water Lock, you won’t be able to answer calls on your watch until you turn it off. To turn off Water Lock, press-and-hold the**home/power** button until it switches off.
10. [Double-check Bluetooth settings if using an iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-bluetooth-devices-to-iphone-2000092) . If you’re using your Galaxy Watch with an iPhone, your phone might display an error the first time you try to make a call from the watch. If so, open your iPhone Bluetooth settings, and you’ll see a second Galaxy Watch listed in the available devices. Connect to that, and you’ll be able to send and receive calls.
11. [Contact Samsung Galaxy Watch support.](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fmobile%2Fwearables%2Fsmartwatches%2Fgalaxy-watch%2F) If none of these solutions work, check with Samsung's tech support to see if there's another issue.
