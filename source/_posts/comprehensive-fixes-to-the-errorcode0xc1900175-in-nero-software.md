## How to Fix Netflix Error Code UI-800-3

 Since error code UI-800-3 can occur on many different devices, some troubleshooting steps might not apply to your specific device. Just move to the next suggested solution.

 These problems can usually be solved by refreshing the information stored on your device. Some general things you can try to fix the Netflix code UI-800-3 error include shutting down your device, clearing the Netflix app cache data, and reinstalling Netflix.

 Follow these steps in the order presented until Netflix is working properly:

1. **Restart the streaming device** . In some cases, fixing error code UI-800-3 is as simple as power cycling your streaming device. This involves completely shutting down the device and then unplugging it. You may need to leave it unplugged for a while, sometimes up to one minute, for this to work.  
 If your streaming device has a sleep mode, make sure to shut down the device completely.
2. **Sign out of Netflix** . In some cases, signing out of Netflix and then signing back in is enough to refresh your data and clear this error. If you have trouble signing out of Netflix on your device, you can do it through the Netflix website. Go to your[Netflix Account page](https://www.netflix.com/YourAccount) and select**Sign out all devices** .  
 This signs out every device that you tied to your account. You will need to reconnect or sign in to each device separately.
3. **Clear the Netflix app data or cache** . Some streaming devices allow you to clear locally stored data without uninstalling the Netflix app. For example, you can[clear the cache on your Fire TV device](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-cache-on-firestick-4177638) from the system settings.
4. **Uninstall the Netflix app, and then reinstall it** . When the Netflix app doesn't have an option to clear the cache or delete local data, you need to uninstall and reinstall the app. This is also necessary in cases where clearing the cache doesn't fix the problem.  
 Some devices come with the Netflix app, and you can't uninstall it.
5. **Reset the device** .[Resetting your Fire TV](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-fire-stick-4176100) or[resetting your Roku](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-roku-4174678) restores the Netflix app to the state it was in when you first downloaded it. If you have a Samsung TV, then fixing error code UI-800-3 may require you to[reset your Samsung Smart Hub](https://www.lifewire.com/reset-samsung-tv-4173258) .
