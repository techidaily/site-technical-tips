## The Player's Handbook on How to Dominate in the Royal Match Challenge

Close 

###  What to Know

* Swipe**left** or**right** to move colored pieces.
* Match three or more of the same colors to clear them. Complete the level’s target within the set number of moves.
* Earn power-ups by matching four or more tiles, and combine them for more powerful effects.

 This article teaches you how to play the mobile game_Royal Match_ and looks at the best strategies to win.

## 'Royal Match' Controls 

 The controls in_Royal Match_ are very simple (though the goals often aren't). Here's how to play.

1. Swipe to move the colored tiles on the board.
2. Items that match with three or more tiles will clear them. You can only make moves that will remove tiles.  
If no moves are possible, the game will shuffle the board.
3. When you clear tiles, the ones above them will fall to fill in the space. Any tiles that match after that shift will clear automatically.
4. When you create a special match item from matching four or more tiles, you can either tap or swipe to activate it.

5. Combining two special items together creates a combo move.  
 You can also buy special items with the coins you either earn by completing levels or buy with in-app purchases.

##  What Is the Object of 'Royal Match'? 

 The rules in_Royal Match_ are pretty simple: You need to complete each level within the assigned number of turns you’re given. 

* **Targets change depending on the level you’re playing** . Early levels can simply involve clearing a few blocks, while later ones might have you clearing blocks that can only be destroyed by using special combo items. Another level type has you clearing the way for birds to drop to the bottom of the screen.
* **Another level type known as King’s Nightmare may use a timer or limit your moves** . These levels require you to free the King from a perilous situation, such as by clearing a path to safety or by destroying items blocking his way. The process is the same–match blocks by swiping to clear them–but you may need to do so within a time limit or a certain number of moves. King’s Nightmare levels are optional.
* **By completing levels, you earn stars to renovate parts of your castle.** Once you’ve unlocked all the parts of one area, you move on to another and continue the process.

 Yes, but you won’t see the end for a long time. There are currently over 8,000 levels, with more added every two weeks. Along with the level-based campaign, you'll also see tournament, challenge, and quest modes with different play styles and goals. The game also has special events.  

 Any time you fail a level, you lose a life. Run out of lives, and you have to wait for them to refresh. You can have a maximum of five lives at once, and you get another one every 15 minutes.

##  What Are the Power-Ups in 'Royal Match'? 

 You get special power-ups in_Royal Match_ –rockets, TNT, propellers, and light balls–by combining four or more items together in different orientations. These can make a big difference to how quickly you clear the level, as they’re more powerful than ordinary moves.

 Here's how to unlock each one:

* **Rocket** : Create a line of four matching tiles. Matching horizontally gets you a rocket that fires vertically and vice versa. Rockets clear the entire row or column you activate them in.
* **TNT** : Match five tiles in an L or T shape. The shape can be in any orientation. TNT destroys everything in a two-tile radius (up to 24 squares total).
* **Propeller** : Combine four matching tiles in a square. When activated, propellers clear adjacent tiles and then fly to another part of the board, also removing whatever it hits.
* **Light ball** : Create a line of five matching tiles. Swap a light ball with another tile to clear all of the ones of the same color, or tap it to remove the tile type that appears most often on the board.

 Along with power-ups, you can also buy or earn boosters that perform various actions without using one of your moves:

* **Royal Hammer** : Removes a single tile.
* **Arrow** : Clears a row.
* **Cannon** : Clears a column.
* **Jester Hat** : Shuffles the board.

##  What Are the Best Combos in 'Royal Match'? 

 You can get even more powerful results by combining power-ups. Here’s a quick look at the combos available.

 You can start a level with a power-up by tapping its icon on the level-start screen. You can also buy items with coins or via in-app purchases.

* **Rocket and Rocket.** Clears the row and column of the tile you combine on.
* **Rocket and TNT.** Clears three rows and three columns of the board.
* **TNT and TNT.** Clears the tiles within a four-tile radius.
* **Propeller and propeller.** Creates three propellers that clear three random tiles, as well as neighboring ones.
* **Propeller and Rocket or TNT.** The propeller carries the TNT or rocket to a random tile.
* **Light ball and rocket or TNT or propeller.** Turns the most commonly colored items on the board into the other item (e.g., all green tiles will become TNT and then activate).
* **Light ball and light ball.** Clears the entire board.
