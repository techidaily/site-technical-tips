The battle of the Pro phones is here: the [Google Pixel 6 Pro](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Telephoto%2Fdp%2FB09HYR2NC8%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ca658cb01-f233-4e66-b74e-79e96f4b65ac%7Cdtp&dtb=1) versus the [iPhone 13 Pro](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPhone-Graphite-Carrier-Subscription%2Fdp%2FB09G98PYLD%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ca658cb01-f233-4e66-b74e-79e96f4b65ac%7Cdtp&dtb=1). Both of these smartphones are equipped with features that can make you enhance your daily activities while empowering your professional endeavors. With the cameras being the focal point of both units' external designs, you can expect some of the best in mobile photography to come from the two. 

While the Pixel 6 Pro at time of release was only $100 cheaper ($899) than the $999.99 iPhone 13 Pro, you're still spending big bucks on either device. To help you make the right buying decision, here are the key reasons why you would want to go with one Pro phone over the other.

###  1\. You want fun and experimental camera features

The Google Pixel has always been known for its exceptional computational photography, and the 6 Pro's camera is [nothing less](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-6-pro-review/). Upgrading from the now discontinued Google Pixel 5, the Pixel 6 Pro incorporates three new camera lenses and allows for up to 4X optical zoom. Housing the improved sensors is a unique visor look that now defines the Pixel phone lineup. 

One standout camera feature on the Pixel 6 Pro is **Motion Mode,** whichallows users to capture a clear photo of a moving object, something you'd typically need a tripod for. Motion Mode includes an Action Pan option to dial up the shutter speed and capture fast-moving subjects like cars and subways. There's also a Long Exposure option that, like Action Pan, adds a creative blur to the background for a "Pro" look and feel. 

Another new and useful feature is **Magic Eraser.** Like Photoshop's Content Aware Fill, the software trick allows you to magically erase unwanted objects from a photo. Using the feature is as simple as circling what you'd like to erase from your image, whether that's strangers in the background, stain marks, or signage, and the Pixel 6 Pro does the rest. When done correctly, the image will look like it was perfectly captured in the first place.

###  2\. You want a bigger battery

While Apple's iPhones have made significant improvements to battery life since the early days, the Google Pixel 6 Pro wins the endurance battle. With 5,003 mAh (versus the iPhone's suggested 3,095 mAh), the Pixel 6 Pro can withstand a day's use with more ease than Apple's Pro phone. Google says the Pixel 6 Pro can support up to 9 hours of YouTube playback with just a single charge, which is close to our in-house experiences. It also helps that the Pixel supports USB-C fast charging, a more standardized method of charging than Apple's proprietary Lightning port.

###  3\. You want a sleek, innovative design

While the iPhone 13 Pro stuck to its traditional, stainless-steel design, only adding a larger camera bump, Google's design broke creative boundaries, especially when compared to previous Pixel generations. Featuring a camera bar that stretches across the back, the Pixel camera doesn't take up half of your phone like that of the iPhone 13 Pro. The bar slightly protrudes from the back glass -- about 3mm from the surface -- which keeps the whole device wobble-free when laid flat. 

With a Gorilla Glass Victus rear and a curved aluminum-edged frame, the Pixel 6 Pro is sleek and durably built. There's also no notch to distract you from viewing content and, instead of FaceID, the Pixel has an in-screen fingerprint scanner that has proven to function accurately. 

Lastly, the Pixel 6 Pro runs on the latest Android 12 software, with Android 13 on the horizon. With improved theme capabilities, new adaptive widgets, and a slew of Android perks, the Pixel software is both pleasing to the eye and practical.

##  You should buy the iPhone 13 Pro if...

###  1\. You want cinematic camera features

Every year, the new "Pro" iPhone comes with a suite of camera features to justify the branding. The 13 Pro introduces a new Macro Mode for close-up shots, photographic styles for quick color overlays, and Cinematic Mode video recording. 

By using the ultra-wide lens, Macro Mode lets you capture close-up shots of subjects -- as close as just 2 centimeters away -- while keeping things sharp and in focus. It's a nifty camera trick that offers a different perspective than the standard wide angle.

The iPhone 13 Pro also features new photographic styles. Different from your typical Instagram filters, these styles change how the iPhone captures photos by placing a cooler, warmer, or even black and white, digital film over the shots. This feature can save you from editing a photo after the fact.

Lastly, Cinematic Mode shoots videos with a soft, out-of-focus background so that the subject of interest and the depth map are kept separate. With AI processing, the focus can intelligently shift when the subject turns around and his or her back is then facing the camera. Overall, the special mode gives a more movie-like quality to your iPhone videos

###  2\. You own other Apple products (AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook, etc.)

There's a reason for Apple's cult following and customer loyalty. Its products have always followed a "strength in numbers" philosophy, enhancing existing services when more than one device is integrated. This interlocking of hardware and software is best described as Apple's walled garden, making it difficult for users to switch out once they're invested. 

While not an actual product, the Apple ecosystem is still very much part of the product you purchase when investing in, say, an iPhone. Your Apple ID credentials serve as the ecosystem's life source, allowing you to manage and protect multiple devices effortlessly. If you already own a pair of AirPods, an Apple Watch, or a MacBook, then buying the iPhone 13 Pro will make more sense usability-wise.

###  3\. You want the best software and hardware support

Along with the ecosystem, the purchase of an Apple device also comes with an extensive software update policy and an abundance of physical storefronts for customer service. Apple is known for providing timely (and somewhat [controversial)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-15-destroyed-your-iphones-battery-life-dont-panic/) iOS updates for as long as seven years after an iPhone is released. Occurring every few months, Apple's regular updates keep your device secure from bugs, security concerns, and other software flaws, while OS updates bring the latest features to your iPhone. 

This support extends to the many physical Apple storefronts, equipped with customer service resources and inventory. With over 272 storefronts in the United States, alone, Apple has a variety of stores you can visit for quality assistance and maintenance. That said, if you prefer in-person troubleshooting, an iPhone may be the better pocket Pro for you.
