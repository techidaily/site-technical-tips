##  How to Change a Microsoft Account Name

 If you're signed in with a Microsoft account you have to change your user name on the Microsoft website.

 To begin, [log in to your Microsoft Account](https://login.live.com/). Edge users will probably be logged in automatically. If you're not using Microsoft Edge as your default browser, you'll have to log in manually. You can also navigate to Settings > Accounts > Your Info and click "Manage My Account" to access the page.

 Once you've logged in, click on your name at the top of the screen.

![Click your name](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/click-your-name.png) 

 Then look towards the bottom-right side of the first section — click "Edit name."

![Click "edit name."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/click-edit-name.png) 

 Fill in your desired user name and the captcha in the popup, then click "Save."

##  How to Change a Local Account Name with Control Panel

 The way you change a user name is different if you're logged in with a local account. You'll need to use Control Panel, since the option isn't available in the Settings App.

 First, click Start. Then, type "Control Panel" into the search bar and hit Enter.

 The user interfaces in Windows 10 and Windows 11 are not identical, though they are similar. Within Control Panel and subsequent menus, the differences are only cosmetic. If something looks a little different, don't worry about it.

 Click "User Accounts" in the Control Panel.

 Then, click "User Accounts" again.

 If [User Account Control (UAC)](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/downloading-samfw-frp-tool-30-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-drfone-android/) presents you with a prompt at this point, go ahead and allow it. Then, type the new name you'd like in the text box. Finally, click "Change Name."

![Enter your new user name in the box, then click &quot;Change Name.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/first-enter-the-new-name-then-click-Change.png)

 Whether you're using a Microsoft account or a local account, you should restart your PC to make sure the changes stick.

 It is also important to note that your user folder will not be renamed or moved. Windows and many other applications store files and settings in sub-folders of your user folder — consequently, it is difficult to change the name of your user folder without breaking things. So if your original user name was Bill, and you changed it to Tom, your user folder will still be "C:\\Users\\Bill" rather than "C:\\Users\\Tom ."
