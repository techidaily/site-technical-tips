## Discover the Enhanced Translation Feature in Firefox 128 – The Latest Update for Seamless Multilingual Browsing

Mozilla Firefox receives major updates roughly every four weeks, giving the web browser a steady stream of bug fixes, new features, and security enhancements. Firefox 128 is rolling out now with more translation features and other improvements.

 Firefox 128 includes a new way to use the browser’s local page translation, which initially [rolled out last year in Firefox 118](https://driver-install.techidaily.com/streamline-network-setup-with-netgear-a6200-software/). There’s now a ‘translation selection’ option in the right-click context menu when text is selected, allowing you to convert parts of a page instead of the entire tab.

 In the United States and Canada, Firefox will now show your recent searches or currently trending searches when you open the address bar. That’s similar to the trending searches functionality that [arrived in Google Chrome for iPhone and iPad](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-change-snapchat-voice-in-minutes-using-twin-methods/) last month. However, it doesn’t work with all search engines—it shows up for me when using Google or Bing, but not DuckDuckGo.

 There are a few smaller changes in Firefox 128 as well. The settings panel for clearing user data is now more organized and readable, protected content from Netflix and other streaming sites now work in Private Browsing mode, microphone audio quality has been improved on Mac, and more types of text files can be viewed in the browser instead of being downloaded.

 Finally, Firefox 128 includes a new experimental feature intended for online advertising, called [Privacy-preserving attribution](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/privacy-preserving-attribution) (PPA). The goal is to allow sites to understand how their ads perform without collecting data about individual people. You can turn it off in the new Website Advertising Preferences section in the Privacy and Security settings, but there’s not really a benefit to doing that.

##  How to Update Firefox

 Firefox will automatically install the update on your computer, phone, or tablet when it's available. To immediately [check for and install any available updates](https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-free-audio-to-text-transformers-for-effortless-file-editing-wondershare-videomaker/), click the menu icon at the top-right of the browser toolbar and select "About Firefox."

 You can download Firefox from [Mozilla's official website](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), the [Google Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004050/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox), [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firefox-private-safe-browser/id989804926), and [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/mozilla-firefox/9NZVDKPMR9RD).
