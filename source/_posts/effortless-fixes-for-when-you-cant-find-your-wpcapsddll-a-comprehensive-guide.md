 This file is used by WinPcap, a[packet capturing program](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-packet-sniffer-2487312) . You can read more about what the file does in the[WinPcap User's Manual](https://www.winpcap.org/docs/docs%5F40%5F2/html/group%5F%5Fwpcap.html) .

 The wpcap.dll error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's[operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , including[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) ,[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) ,[Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) ,[Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) ,[Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and Windows 2000.

## How to Fix Wpcap.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download wpcap.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore the file from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" wpcap.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free data recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) . Just make sure the file was working properly when you did that (i.e., it wasn't corrupt or malicious).  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some wpcap.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
3. Install or reinstall[Npcap](https://npcap.com/) (preferable for Windows 11/10) or[WinPcap](https://www.winpcap.org/install/) . These are pieces of software that many other programs use to support their software, and a major component is the wpcap.dll file.

![npcap setup](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3MEo-mKdog7AZ5Whrt2LM6KdKfs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/npcap-download-1171a8bb6633499ab4e6829b3d906370.png)  
 Try your best to complete this step. Since these programs are very likely the best source of the file, installing or reinstalling one of them should fix this DLL issue.
4. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the wpcap.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
5. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to wpcap.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file wpcap.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 The wpcap.dll file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
6. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if wpcap.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
7. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . I've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause wpcap.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
8. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair wpcap.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid wpcap.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 I rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. They're included here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
9. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the hard drive and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the wpcap.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during a clean installation. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
10. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any wpcap.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.

## Causes of Wpcap.dll Error Messages
