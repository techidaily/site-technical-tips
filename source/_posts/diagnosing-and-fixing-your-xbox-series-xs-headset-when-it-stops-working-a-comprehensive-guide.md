## How to Fix Mfc71.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're listed below to try the more likely fixes first.

 Do not download the mfc71.dll DLL file individually from any "DLL download site." There are many reasons why[downloading DLLs from these sites is never a good idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's always best to obtain it from its legitimate, original source.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . Sometimes mfc71.dll errors are one-time issues and a simple reboot will fix the problem. It's not a very likely solution, but it's an easy first step that could just save the day.
2. [Reinstall the program or game](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) .
