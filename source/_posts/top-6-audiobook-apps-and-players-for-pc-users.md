I am looking for an app that will allow me to download audio books to an external hard drive, while still allowing me to listen to them. I cannot have hundreds of files on my pc, because I do not have mush space. 

 What are some better options over Audible? I ask because I selected to download my books to my external hard drive and it is taking up space on my pc regardless. I also cannot find where the books are being downloaded on my pc. When I try to use the files from my hard rive, they apparently do not exists.

First of all, can you tell us where did you get the audiobook? Do you get them from Audible or just download some free audiobooks from some free websites? Then we may figure out which one is the best one for you.

 Also what do you mean that " when I try to use the files from my harddrive, they apparently do not exists"?Are you sure you have these books downloaded successfully? If yes, you should figure the default path of these download files. Then you can find it easily next time.

Better to use a USB flash drive! Color code or number to keep track of what is on it via companion spread sheet data correlation file.

 I purchased for $40 125Gigs but Microsoft will steal about 300Megs to align USB to system. Can not prevent this. Those who tried to bypass this have memory issues and lose data.

 Playing a file while also transferring it can be done. My advise delay play of audio book for 30-40 seconds before play. Most computers built after 2013 will transfer the file in under 3-4 minutes for even the largest audio books. Example: Founding Fathers a rather long audio book too 2:44 to transfer to USB which I can play on any devise including my Smartphone.

If you were referring to Microsoft stealing space on the USB stick, Then you again are a moron.

 Windows requires USB shareware software to allow information sharing between USB stick and Computer. As to which version of the software used by Microsoft, it depends on system you are running as there are about 8 different ones used.

I'm looking for programs. App's are for mobile telephones, ipads and such, no mather what Microsoft and others try to confuse users with.  
 So we who still hangs on chance as positive and risk as negative, are lost when people name programs as app's.  
 Thank you for not being one of those airheads.

Talk about being a total moronic idiot. Do you even realize the stupidity of your own statement?

 The question was about storage and ease of use concerning audio book files which are nothing more than common media files. 

 The question was how to transfer to other devises with out issues. The most simple solution is with a USB Stick! Transfer the media file to the USB and open it in the other devise. Easy peasy!

Another option is not to transfer the audio files at all! AudioWeb by MollieSoft lets you keep the audio files on your PC, and runs a personal web server allowing you to access the audio files in any web browser on any device: iPhone, iPad, Android, etc. The web interface has unlimited bookmarks, and an explorer and search facility.

No he probado la app del celular pero sí la Desktop. La instalé hace varios años (en realidad venía con un audiolibro que compré) y hoy la actualicé a su última versión (mayo-2023). Genero gran parte de mis audiobooks con Calibre a partir de epub y necesitaba una aplicación que permitiera variar la velocidad y que tuviera memoria (última frase en que abandoné la escucha) y ésta es la única que encontré que cumple más o menos estos requisitos.  
 Para mí sería mejor que permitiera acelerar en forma libre pues hoy están puestos los porcentajes fijos y el mínimo es 20% que no es poco.   
 También sería óptimo poder dejar "marcas" como tiene Ivoox, con pequeños comentarios y otro tipo de señales con shortcuts para accionarlos rápidamente al escuchar.  
 Todavía no he probado los subtítulos. Pienso que a partir de un epub puede ser fácil generar un srt.  
 Estoy bastante conforme con la aplicación.
