## Watch Top-Rated TV and Cinema Classics Ahead of Time on Crackle - FREE VIEWING

Close 

 Crackle is a website that lets you stream free movies and watch free TV shows on your computer, phone, and tablet.

 Although you'll need to sit through a few commercial breaks during the movies and shows at Crackle, an awesome selection of programming, as well as decent video quality, will have you coming back again and again.

 This[ free video streaming service](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-free-movies-online-1356647) was originally called Grouper when it was first released, but later changed its name to Sony Crackle, and finally just Crackle.

##  Free Crackle Movies & Shows 

 Crackle regularly has dozens of free, full-length movies that you watch any time you want. New movies are constantly being added and retired, so you'll always find something new to watch.

 Movies at Crackle are organized into genres to help you find thrillers,[ comedies](https://www.lifewire.com/where-to-watch-free-comedy-movies-online-1357448) , Crackle Originals,[ action movies](https://www.lifewire.com/where-to-watch-free-action-movies-online-1357447) , dramas, crime movies,[ horror films](https://www.lifewire.com/where-to-watch-free-horror-movies-online-legally-1357650) , and more. You can sort the free movies alphabetically or by recently added so you can check back as often as you want to see what's new.

 In addition to movie-length videos are movie clips, trailers, and information on movies that are about to become available on Crackle.

 Crackle also lets you stream free TV shows from hundreds of series that include full episodes of comedies, anime, action, and thriller series.

![A list of free TV shows at Crackle](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/aQCNQivnlPAID4xHbNh6lA33h-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/crackle-free-tv-shows-8669ee7f2deb4a948f1f11823f3a65a6.png) 

 Like the movies section, the TV shows you can find here include full episodes, clips, and trailers, including original Crackle series that you can't find anywhere else.

 Crackle keeps videos during a particular time frame and then removes them. This means if you watch part of a movie one day, it's quite possible it could be gone the next before you can finish it. While this isn't ideal, it's still fine for most people since you probably usually watch a movie from beginning to end. Plus, the movies are free, so it's hard to complain.

 If you ever struggle to find something new to watch for free on Crackle, consider trying a different free movie streaming service like[ Pluto TV](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-pluto-tv-4774389) ,[ Freevee](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-amazon-freevee-7557868) , or[ YouTube](https://www.lifewire.com/youtube-s-free-streaming-movies-and-tv-shows-1357439) .

##  How to Stream Crackle Movies & Shows 

 Crackle works on lots of devices. You can follow the links above to see the movies and shows on your computer, but there's also a Crackle movie app so that you can stream the videos on your phone or tablet.

 You can download the Crackle mobile app on iOS devices, Android phones and tablets, and other devices.

**Download For:** 

[ Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gotv.crackle.handset&hl=en%5FUS) 

[ iOS ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crackle-movies-tv/id377951542) 

 It's super simple to use the app because while it shows all of Crackle's content, it's organized very well to prevent clutter. You can move left to right in each genre to find all the movies and shows that belong to it. When you choose a video, you can find all the details you can see on Crackle's desktop site, such as the cast and a description of the video.

 Crackle also works with streaming devices like Roku and Chromecast, video game consoles, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Blu-Ray players, and more.

## The Ads Are Worth It 

 Because Crackle is free, it uses advertising in both movies and TV shows. One appears at the beginning of the video and then more will appear as you watch. The shorter the video, the fewer advertisements you’ll see, which seems appropriate.

 For example, a 20-minute episode of a TV show might have three advertisements whereas a movie that’s an hour and a half may have as many as nine.

 You can clearly see where the advertisements are in a video. If you put your mouse into the video player and attempt to fast-forward, you’ll notice short yellow lines that indicate advertisements. It's fortunate these are there so you know how far you can fast-forward the video without having to watch another ad.

 Advertisements might tend to be longer than you'd expect. As you skip forward in the video, multiple ads might play back to back. In these circumstances, the ads might last a total of a minute, so they're still tolerable.

##  Video Quality and Player Options 

 The video quality for movies and shows on Crackle is decent but not great as you might experience on other websites like[ Tubi](https://www.lifewire.com/free-online-tubi-tv-1357455) . If viewing movies and TV shows on a very large, high-definition screen, this relatively low quality will surely be noticed. However, the movies we tested seemed about as clear as a regular DVD on a normal computer screen.

 As for buffering, we had absolutely no hiccups or stalls when watching several TV shows and movies. From the moment a video started to the point that an advertisement would show, there were no delays due to buffering. There were also no delays when starting a video midway—it would begin to play just moments later from wherever it was clicked.

 We've seen lots of comments about how Crackle's videos are too hard to watch because they take too long to buffer. This wasn't our experience, but whether it's yours depends entirely on your own network bandwidth and computer speed.  

 We also like that Crackle's movies and TV shows can be displayed in full-screen mode to get that theater-like experience at home.

 Below the video is an**Add to Watchlist** button, video description, cast list, and other movies you might like. If you're watching a series, you'll see links to other seasons (if there are any).
