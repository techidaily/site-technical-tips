2. **[How can I set up a VPN on Xbox One](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Why should I set up a VPN on Xbox One?

 We recommend using a**VPN(Virtual private network) on Xbox One** based on following benefits. You’ll find it worth having an Xbox One VPN.

 1)**A VPN keeps your privacy and other data on Xbox One safe.**
 While you’re playing Xbox One games, there exist the same security risks as your any other online activity.  
 Your IP address, email address, passwords, credit card information and other private information would be collected and stored through Xbox One console. Hackers or the government may locate them from the saved logs.  
 But with a VPN service, your identity and all your other data will be encrypted so that you can play games or stream media freely.

 2)**A VPN helps you win a better Xbox One gaming experience.**
 The VPN is able to switch virtual locations, which means it’ll connect your device to gaming servers located in different countries.  
 In this case, a VPN shorten the connection routes between you and gaming servers to reduce the ping times and overall lag. Then you can play games much faster.

 3)**A VPN helps you gain access to extra Xbox One games.**
 A VPN can connect your device to gaming servers located in different countries.  
 That is to say, you’ll have access to play games those are restricted or not yet released in your country. Or you can still play games not available when traveling.

 Sounds appealing? Isn’t it? Move on to the next part to see how to set up an Xbox One VPN.

### How can I set up a VPN on Xbox One?

 There are two methods to set up a VPN for Xbox One: through either your Wi-Fi router or your computer. The step-by-step guides for both ways will be shown below.  
 You can just pick the way you prefer.

1. **[Set up an Xbox One VPN through my Wi-Fi router](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Set up an Xbox One VPN through my computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### Option 1: Set up an Xbox One VPN through my Wi-Fi router

 You can easily set up an Xbox One VPN through a Wi-Fi router by configuring a VPN subscription into a VPN-compatible router.

Here’s how you can do it:

 1)**Make sure you have a VPN-compatible Wi-Fi router** .  
 On a VPN-compatible Wi-Fi router’s control panel, there’s a place for you to set up a VPN connection. If your router isn’t enabled for VPN, easily get a new one through[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Linksys-Dual-Band-Wireless-Tri-Stream-WRT3200ACM/dp/B01JOXW3YE/&tag=easeware-aprilcai-20) .

 2) **Buy a VPN subscription.**

 There are many VPN services you can find online, but keep in mind that **choose a reputable one** .

 Before you determine the specific one, please:  
 1\. **Read the provider’s terms of service** as much carefully as you can.  
 2\. Find out   **what its policy says about sharing the information with third-parties** .  
 3\. Importantly, please **ignore any free VPN services** as they might make money in other ways, like: they may show ads which absolutely disrupt your gaming experience or sell your information to marketers.

 We recommend[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) as your best pick for its military-grade encryption. If you decide to choose NordVPN, here’s a[NordVPN coupon code](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) for you!

 3)**Access your Wi-Fi router’s setting.**
 You can do this by**typing your router’s IP address into a web browser** . If you don’t know your router’s IP address, you can

a) get it through your Windows computer:

 Open a command prompt window, then type**ipconfig** and press Enter. Default Gateway from the result shows your router’s IP address.

 4)**Configure your Wi-Fi router’s setting.**
 Enter the details of your VPN subscription(IP, Subnet Mask, username and password, etc) into your Wi-Fi router’s setting.  
 Usually it’s located in the tab called ‘**Basic** ‘, ‘**Network** ‘, or ‘**WAN Setup** ‘. It varies from different router models.  
 You may access the window that looks like this one:
