### Note

 Netflix ended its DVD rental service on September 29, 2023\. See[Netflix's FAQ](https://dvd.netflix.com/Faq) for more information. This article remains for archival purposes.

 Netflix used to have two separate services: an online streaming platform you access through[www.netflix.com](https://www.netflix.com) and other apps, and also a DVD rental program via dvd.netflix.com, where they sent you DVDs through the mail.

 Netflix's DVD program included some TV shows and movies that weren't available through[their streaming service](https://www.lifewire.com/overview-of-the-netflix-streaming-service-1847831) . You could watch both DVDs and Blu-rays, and there were a few plans to pick from depending on how many discs you wanted to borrow at once.

## Netflix's DVD Plans

 There are three DVD Netflix plans. All of them offer unlimited discs per month, no late fees, free shipping and returns, DVDs and Blu-rays, and no long-term commitment (just month-by-month).

 The only difference between these plans is the number of discs you can have at once:

* **Basic** : $9.99 /month; one disc at a time
* **Standard** : $14.99 /month; two discs at a time
* **Premium** : $19.99 /month; three discs at a time

## How to Sign Up for DVD Netflix

 These directions are for using a desktop web browser, but you can also sign up with the DVD Netflix mobile app.

## How to Choose DVDs

 Netflix automatically sends DVDs to you based on what you've added to your personal queue. The order in which you receive them is based on the way they're arranged within the queue.

 Once you've returned the DVD, the next title on the list is sent, and so on.

 Here's how to add movies to your DVD Netflix queue and then adjust which ones you'll get first:

### From a Computer

1. From DVD Netflix, select**Add to Queue** or**Add** , depending on the screen you're looking at, next to any DVD you want.
