## Supported Devices and Setup

 Line works on iOS (iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch), Android, and BlackBerry devices. It is also available for Windows PCs and on macOS.

 The setup is simple. After it's installed and launched, Line walks you through the registration process, which is performed via your phone number. You'll want to double-check that the number is correct, then verify the registration with a code sent to your phone.

 During the registration process, Line asks to access your contacts. You can disallow this access if you choose. This option authorizes Line to browse your device's contacts and build a friends list in the app based on those contacts, showing which of your contacts are on Line.

 On Windows and Mac systems, Line asks you to register your email address. A code is sent to your email address for verification. If you change your phone number or mobile device, you can use your email address to log in and access your account information. The next time you log in, select**Email/QR code login** beneath the login fields to access your account using email.

 Line asks you to create a display name (up to 20 characters). You can then choose if you want others to be able to add you as a friend. (If you do not, uncheck the box at the bottom.)

## Official Accounts Terms of Use

 Official accounts on Line are run by businesses and organizations. Interacting with them requires acceptance of the Official Accounts Terms of Use. When you add an official account as a friend or interact with one, the official account obtains access to view your profile information. This includes your display name, profile media, status message, and your internal identifier, which is a unique character string given to users upon signing up.

 If you choose**Cancel** , you will not be able to interact with or add official accounts, which include news outlets like CNN, TechCrunch, and Wikipedia, as well as celebrities. Each time you attempt to interact with an official account, you'll receive the Official Accounts Terms of Use verification prompt. The Line system is considered an official account, so any messages from Line prompt you to accept this additional agreement.
