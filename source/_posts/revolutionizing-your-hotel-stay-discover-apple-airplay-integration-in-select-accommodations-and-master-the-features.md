### What's the best gaming laptop deal on Prime Day?

There are a lot of great gaming laptops on sale right now, but in our opinion, [this deal on the Razer Blade 16](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRazer-Blade-Gaming-Laptop-4090-13th%2Fdp%2FB0BQP1WCP4%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ca9ce9008-3603-459e-8a58-f4457742ba16%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is the best.

### Is Amazon Prime Day a good time to buy a laptop?

### How did we choose these Prime Day deals?

At ZDNET, we only write about deals our team members would want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. We looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.

We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we recommend. These recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.
