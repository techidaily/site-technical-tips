## Micromobile Universe Explored: Timelines, News Roundup, Whispers & Comprehensive Insights
 Micromobility solutions focus on using new technologies beyond the car to encourage people to use mass transit or lighter options to reduce clogged roads and improve commuting and travel in urban areas. Micromobility World kicked off in 2021 and is the first to focus solely on this technology area.[Micromobility Industries](https://micromobility.io/) sponsors the event.
