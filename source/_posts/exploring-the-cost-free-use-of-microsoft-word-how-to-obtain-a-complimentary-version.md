## Exploring the Cost-Free Use of Microsoft Word: How to Obtain a Complimentary Version

Close 

 You can get Word for free, completely legally. Microsoft offers a few really simple solutions.

## Microsoft Word Online 

 One free Microsoft Word method is[ Word Online](https://www.office.com/launch/word) . It's the quickest and easiest way to use Word without paying. It's available through a web browser (just like[ Google Docs](https://www.lifewire.com/google-docs-1356602) ) on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and supports all major web browsers including Edge, Chrome, Safari, etc.

 Word Online automatically uses[ Microsoft OneDrive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-onedrive-and-how-does-it-work-5093633) for storage, so saved documents are accessible on any device with an internet connection. OneDrive's free plan has limited storage, but because Word documents are typically small, you can create and store hundreds of documents. Alternatively, you can download your Word document to your computer before closing the web browser.

## Microsoft 365 for Mobile 

 If you are going to go the mobile route,[ Microsoft offers the free Microsoft 365 app](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/mobile) for Android and iOS. You can download it from the Google Play Store on Android or Apple App Store on iOS.

 Like Word Online, the mobile app requires a Microsoft account and will save documents to OneDrive by default. And it bundles Word with other popular Office apps including Excel and PowerPoint. Unlike the web-based version, the mobile app can access offline files so you can work without an internet connection.

 The Microsoft 365 app is a bit more basic than Word Online, but it supports all the essentials. It lets you open documents, change text, format text, create new documents, export to PDF, and share and print files.

 In our experience, it's far easier to use on a mobile device than Word Online, which is often buggy or slow when used from a phone or tablet. The dedicated app feels slick and fast even on older devices.

##  Is Word Free On a PC and Mac? 

 There's an important version of Microsoft Word you can't use for free: the desktop app.

 This is a source of confusion for those who buy a new computer that comes with a Microsoft 365 trial. Most Windows installations have Word and other Microsoft apps installed by default. You can launch the desktop version of Word to view documents for free, but editing is locked until you pay.

##  Other Ways to Use Microsoft Word for Free 

 Microsoft Word Online and the Microsoft 365 app are the most common ways to use Word for free. However, there are a few situations that might let you access Word without paying:

* **Microsoft 365 Family account** : Microsoft 365 supports family sharing with up to five other people. This is a great way to access Word at no added cost.
* **Older Word version with a license** : Older versions of Word lack the latest features, but they'll handle the basics. It's worth giving an older version of Word a shot if you have a license key available.
* **Word Mobile** :[ Microsoft offers Word Mobile](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9wzdncrfjb9s) to use on devices with a screen size no larger than 10.1 inches. Larger devices can open the app but can't use it to edit documents without payment. This version of free Word works on Windows 10 v15063.0 and higher.

##  Microsoft Word Can be Free, but Know the Limitations 

 Using Microsoft Word for free comes with limitations. These vary based on your platform but, in general, using a free edition of Word will restrict formatting and page setup options to a basic set of tools. In other words, if you're used to using the desktop version of Word, you'll have to sacrifice some features when you switch to the free edition.

 Additionally, you need a Microsoft account. This isn't all bad considering most Windows users already have one and it's easy to[ make a new Microsoft account](https://www.lifewire.com/create-new-outlook-email-1170658) if necessary.
