## The best gifts when you don't know what to gift

Apple AirTags are hands-down my favorite Apple product ever to exist. The tiny Bluetooth trackers help me survive everyday life and are by far the most versatile tech item I own. From helping me find my lost wallet to tracking my checked bag at the airport, Apple AirTags have endless use case possibilities. (They're also on sale right now at most retailers for $80, down from the usual $100.)

**Also:** [7 ways AirTags can simplify your life (beyond tracking keys)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/seven-ways-apple-airtags-can-help-you-beyond-tracking-keys/)

I got my first pack of Apple AirTags as a holiday gift two years ago from a friend, and since then, the Bluetooth trackers have become my go-to gift when I don't know what to gift. In all honesty, I probably would have never purchased AirTags if I hadn't gotten them myself as a gift. But now that I have incorporated them into my day-to-day life, I can't live without them. And while I may be biased towards Apple AirTags as my go-to Bluetooth tracker due to their Apple ecosystem integration, [bluetooth trackers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-bluetooth-tracker/), in general, make great gifts whenever you don't know what to gift.

If you're looking for a useful gift that falls on the less expensive side, Anker's latest Nano Power Bank is the ideal gift for hardcore phone users -- which, let's be real, is almost all of us nowadays. As we spend more time on our devices, and in turn, their batteries are stretched thin, power banks and portable chargers become essential to survive day-to-day. 

Anker's Nano 22.5W Power Bank was made with portability in mind. The lipstick-sized charger features a foldable USB-C port and offers impressive charging power for its size, ZDNET's Sabrina Ortiz said in her [review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-anker-usb-c-power-bank-solved-my-biggest-problem-with-portable-chargers/).

Smart speakers are the ideal gift for busy individuals looking to automate their home and daily tasks. These devices can help streamline routines, set reminders, create shopping lists, check the weather, set timers, manage your calendar, and more, all by the command of your voice. 

Sonos' Era 100 smart speaker is no different. Featuring Sonos voice and Alexa, this speaker is compatible with many streaming services, including Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora, and includes Bluetooth connectivity. When testing the Sonos Era 100, ZDNET's home tech expert Maria Diaz found the smart speaker had improved audio quality and touch controls compared to its predecessor, making it the go-to speaker she [recommends to most people this holiday season](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/why-i-recommend-the-sonos-era-100-to-most-people-this-holiday-season/).   
We are aware the Sonos Era 100 is on the pricier side of gifts; However, if you are looking for a worthwhile gift to give your parents, grandparents, or a special someone in your life, the Sonos Era 100 is a high-quality speaker, that anyone can enjoy.

Mugs are already a popular choice when it comes to gift exchanges or Secret Santa events, but a techy one that keeps your beverage of choice warm for the entire day will surely be a hit. Finish your cup of coffee or tea at your own pace, and never worry about finding a lukewarm drink. Just control the temperature with your smartphone, and make every sip a joyful one. 

ZDNET's Kayla Solino swears by the Ember Mug 2 and said she loves that the mug comes in aesthetic and functional models. "The Ember Mug is one of those things you convince yourself you absolutely don't need because it feels absurd to spend over $100 on a mug when you probably have tons in the cabinet and you own a microwave. But once you try it, you will never go back -- and won't ever think about how expensive of a purchase it was," Solino said. 

While the Ember Mug is usually $150, you can find it for $104 at Amazon, making now the best time to buy it as a gift for your loved ones.

If you are shopping for a bookworm or traveler in your life, an e-reader is an ideal gift they can take on the go no matter their endeavors. Kindles are extremely portable and convenient when commuting to work, waiting at an airport, or enjoying that well-deserved vacation. 

Kindles give users easy access to a wide range of reading materials, and some are even waterproof up to 2 meters, which means you can take it to the beach or pool for some entertainment while you soak up some sun. The Kindle Paperwhite is ZDNET's pick for the best Kindle reader overall due to its excellent battery life, ease of use, and glare-free coating. However, if you want a more affordable e-reader or a pricier one with fancier features, you can check out ZDNET's Nina Raemont's [Kindle buying guide](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-kindle/) to find the perfect pick for your gift.
