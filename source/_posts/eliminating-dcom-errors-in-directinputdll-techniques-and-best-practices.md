## Android SMS Silence: Overcoming Communication Glitches and Getting Notified Again
 Missing and delayed text messages can be frustrating, especially since you may not be aware of the problem until somebody contacts you using another method to ask why you're not responding or where you are. Luckily, you can address the problem quickly.

## The Causes of Delayed or Missing Texts on Android

 Text messaging has three components: the devices, the app, and the network. These components have multiple points of failure. The device may not be working correctly, the network may not be sending or receiving messages, or the app may have a bug or other malfunction.

 In some cases, these causes aren't easy to diagnose. For example, text messages may be delayed because the[cellular network](https://www.lifewire.com/how-does-a-mobile-network-work-2373338) is overwhelmed with traffic. It's best to start with the most common problem and work your way down the list since there are many potential points of failure.

## How to Fix Androids Not Receiving Texts

 If you're not getting texts that you know someone is trying to send you, these troubleshooting steps can help clear up the issue. Before getting started, it's always a good idea to test your ability to receive texts from a few different people, if possible. That could yield some clues as to what the problem might be.

1. [Check the network connection](https://www.lifewire.com/check-network-connection-status-of-wireless-devices-818268) . Mobile networks can be unpredictable. If you see a few or no bars, step outside or find a higher place indoors. If you're in your home, you can use a[signal booster](https://www.lifewire.com/cell-phone-signal-boosters-4148146) to improve reception throughout the home.
2. Check your cellular provider's website or social media pages for outage reports. Before we get into addressing device-specific issues, it's important to know whether your carrier is having network problems.  
 Look for any alerts or updates concerning network issues. If there are problems on their end, there's nothing you can do but wait it out.  
[Is Verizon Down... Or Is It Just You?](https://www.lifewire.com/is-verizon-down-or-is-it-just-you-5069423)  
 Remember, some texting apps can be used reliably over Wi-Fi. If you use Snapchat, WhatsApp, Signal, Facebook Messenger, etc., all you need is a decent Wi-Fi connection. If you're not seeing texts in those apps,[reboot your wireless network](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570) or contact your ISP.
3. [Disable Airplane Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-airplane-mode-on-or-off-on-android-5212172) . When this feature is turned on, it prevents your phone from reaching the network, which is necessary for receiving texts.  
 Even if Airplane Mode is off already, switch it on for five seconds via the[Quick Settings menu](https://www.lifewire.com/quick-settings-menu-android-4121299) , and then turn it back off. This will re-establish a connection to the mobile network and could fix the texting issue.
4. [Reboot the phone](https://www.lifewire.com/reboot-android-smartphone-or-tablet-4127180) . Sometimes there are endless loops or other issues behind the scenes that you may be unable to diagnose but are easily solved with a reboot.
5. [Check for blocked numbers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-unblock-a-number-android-phone-4161082) . You can't get texts from a number you've blocked. If you know someone is trying to reach you over text but you're not seeing any of their messages, double-check your list of blocked numbers and remove them from that list if necessary.
6. [Deregister iMessage](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-the-imessage-android-bug-with-this-free-tool-1999583) . If you formerly used an iPhone, ask anyone who regularly texts with you with an iPhone to either disable iMessage or send you a new text at your number, instead of contacting you from an old text thread. An iMessage thread doesn't translate over to Android.

7. [Update Android](https://www.lifewire.com/update-your-android-os-121662) . Install any outstanding operating system updates, even if an update doesn't seem relevant to the problem you are experiencing. Some bug fixes and other repairs may address operations or features the texting app uses. Wait for any updates to finish before texting.
8. [Update your texting app](https://www.lifewire.com/update-apps-on-android-7106106) . Updates often resolve obscure issues or bugs that may prevent your texts from sending.
9. [Clear the texting app's cache](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-cache-android-4157780) . Then, reboot the phone and restart the app.

 After trying all these steps, if you're still having trouble, it might be time to look for a newer phone. Android models range anywhere from $150 to $2,000; we've tested many phones, so be sure to review our recommendations before you buy.
