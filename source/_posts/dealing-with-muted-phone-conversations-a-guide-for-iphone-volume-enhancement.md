##  Why the iPhone Volume Is Low 

 There could be a variety of reasons your iPhone in-call volume is suddenly low. You might have accidentally toggled the volume rocker while on another call. It's also possible there is an obstruction preventing you from hearing the other caller. Or you could have a software or hardware problem.

 Even something as simple as an operating system update could be the cause of low volume, so the best thing to do is work through the troubleshooting steps below until you find the solution.

##  How Do You Fix Low Call Volume on iPhone? 

 Increasing the call volume on your iPhone might be as simple as turning the volume up or as tricky as replacing some hardware. Try these steps, which we've outlined in order of the easiest thing to try to the most difficult.  

1. Turn the volume up on your phone. It sounds super simple, but if you're having issues hearing people when they call, it could be as simple as adjusting the in-call volume.  
 The thing about it is, you have to do it while you're on a call. So, the next time someone calls you, use the**Volume Up** button on your phone to see if you can turn the volume back to a level comfortable to hear.
2. Confirm that your phone case or screen protector isn't blocking your speakers. If they are, it could make the audio sound muffled or garbled during phone calls.
3. [ Clean your iPhone speakers](https://www.lifewire.com/clean-iphone-speakers-4692263) . Speakers full of lint and dust is a common reason for muffled call volume.
4. Flip the silence switch on the side of the phone. This physical switch is used to quickly silence your phone, but some users report that toggling it on and off a few times fixed their iPhone's low call volume.  
 Orange is active (meaning notifications are silenced), and silver is inactive (meaning all your sounds come through).
5. [ Toggle Airplane Mode on and off](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-iphone-airplane-mode-2000238) . Low in-call volume can sometimes be fixed by switching between this mode a few times. Give it a try, but ensure that the final position for Airplane Mode is**Off** so that you don't block new incoming calls.
6. [ Restart your iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restart-iphone-2000288) . Sometimes, devices need a good restart. Nothing needs to happen to them, and you could be doing everything right, but features may not work correctly. Whatever the problem is, it's a universal truth that a simple restart can do wonders for electronics, so take a few seconds and restart your phone, then try your calls again.
7. [ Use Control Center](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-control-center-on-iphone-and-ipod-touch-4103833) to see if the audio is being transmitted through the phone or a Bluetooth device. If there's a triangle with concentric circles over the top of it, it means the audio is coming through the iPhone.  
 If that indicator is not there, there could be a Bluetooth speaker, headphones, or other device connected to your phone. Disconnect that device to restore audio to your iPhone.
8. [ Update your iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-iphones-operating-system-2000293) . Something as simple as an outdated operating system could be the culprit if you're having trouble hearing callers on your iPhone. Make sure your device is entirely up to date, then try making your calls again.  
 Know, however, that sometimes an update from Apple seems to actually_cause_ this low volume problem. While you could[ downgrade iOS](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-downgrade-ios-without-losing-data-4771805) to the prior version, it might be best to simply wait for a fix from Apple.  
 If you're using Bluetooth headphones and experiencing low call volume through the headphones, make sure those are updated as well. A driver issue could interfere with call volume and sound delivery; updating can fix the problem.
9. Disable Noise Cancellation. Noise cancellation is an accessibility feature on iPhone, and it can be handy to help some users hear more clearly. However, some people experiencing problems hearing callers on their iPhone report turning Noise Cancellation off greatly improved in-call volume.  
 To turn off Noise Cancellation, go to**Settings** \>**Accessibility** \>**Audio/Visual** and toggle Noise Cancellation**Off** (green is On).  
Only iPhone 12 and earlier have this feature.

##  When All Else Fails, Call In the Professionals 

 If you worked through all these troubleshooting steps, or the phone has physical damage (such as water damage or drop damage), you may need to call in professionals.[ Check your warranty status](https://www.lifewire.com/is-your-phone-under-warranty-2000667) , then[ make a Genius Bar appointment](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-an-apple-genius-bar-appointment-1999601) , or visit your local Apple-authorized repair shop, to see if they can fix the problem for you.

 FAQ

* Why can no one hear me on my iPhone?  
 Your microphone or call volume is low or muted. There could also be a problem with your microphone. Make sure it's not clogged with dust.
* Why is my iPhone volume low when playing music?  
 You could have a volume limit set. Go to**Settings** \>**Music** and make sure the**Volume Limit** slider is all the way to the right.
* Why is my iPhone volume low when I move?  
 If the sound keeps lowering or cutting out while you're talking on the phone, you could be in a place with a poor signal. If you're indoors, try moving to a window or go outside if possible to see if that helps with reception.
