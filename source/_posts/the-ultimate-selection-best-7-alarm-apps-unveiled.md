 What We Like

* Extra loud ringtones for heavy sleepers
* Different "missions" depending on your needs (e.g., shake, math problems, photos, barcode scanning)

 What We Don't Like

 If you have difficulty rolling out of bed, Alarmy can help you rise and shine. What makes this one different (and annoying, in a good way) is that you’re required to perform other tasks before you can shut the alarm off. For example, you can turn off the alarm by shaking it 50 times, completing a math problem, or snapping a photo of your coffee mug. While it’s not an alarm for everyone, it can be helpful for folks who hit the snooze button longer than they should.

 Sleep as Android is a highly-rated two-in-one “sleep cycle and smart alarm” app for Android users. Unlike other apps with alarm clocks, this one gives you greater insight into your sleep cycle so you can get a better night’s rest. It “studies” and analyzes your sleep patterns using a sonar contactless ultrasonic sleep tracking system (i.e., you don't have to sleep with your phone).

 The app tracks your sleep duration, deficits, deep sleep percentage, and irregularities such as snoring. It works with[ Samsung Health](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-health-how-it-works-4172072) and Google Fit, and is compatible with[ Spotify](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-spotify-4685829) for radio and music alarms.
