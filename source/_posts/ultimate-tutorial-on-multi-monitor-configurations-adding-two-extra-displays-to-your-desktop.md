## How Do I View Past Notifications on iPhone?

 Notifications that have recently popped up on your iPhone’s lock screen should remain visible for some time. However, eventually, they will disappear or be replaced by more recent ones. If you happen to miss any notifications, recalling them is simple.

 Attempting to view older (but still active) notifications on your iPhone’s lock screen uses the same steps regardless of whether you allow notifications to display on a locked iPhone.

1. If your iPhone’s screen is turned off, turn it on by tapping it or, depending on which iPhone you have, pressing either the**Power** or**Home** button.
2. Swipe up from the middle of your iPhone’s Lock Screen to pull up a list of notifications. If there are no notifications, you’ll see**No Older Notifications** appear instead.
3. Depending on the number of pending notifications, you may see all of them or be organized into groups based on the apps that generated the notifications.

4. Tap a notification, such as a text, to open the connected app.  
 If your iPhone is locked, you must unlock it with Face ID, Touch ID, or your password to continue.
5. Swipe left on a notification (or grouping of notifications) to pull up the**Options** and**Clear/Clear All** buttons.
6. Tap**Options** to pull up a small menu to adjust notification settings for the app the notification originated from. If desired, you can use the menu to mute or turn off notifications for the app.

7. Tap**Clear** or**Clear All** (depending on if there's one or several notifications in one category) to delete notifications from an organized group.  
 This action will remove existing notifications from your Lock Screen until new ones appear but will not affect anything from within the app itself. It will also not affect notifications badges appearing on the app’s icon.
8. If you want to delete all current notifications at once, tap**X** (next to Notification Center), then tap**Clear All Notifications** . As with**Clear All** , this will remove existing notifications from your iPhone’s lock screen.

 If the notifications have not been deleted and can't be seen when you first turn on your iPhone's screen, you should be able to view them by following the same steps as above.
