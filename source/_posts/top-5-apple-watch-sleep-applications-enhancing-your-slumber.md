 If you spend much time on Facebook and love watching user-uploaded videos and live news feeds,[Facebook Watch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facebook-watch-4175805) may be the app to check out.

 What We Don't Like

* Although cable subscription isn't required, you still have to pay a subscription fee via the app.
