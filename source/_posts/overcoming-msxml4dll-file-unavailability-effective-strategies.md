## Overcoming Msxml4.DLL File Unavailability: Effective Strategies
 Msxml4.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the msxml4 [DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) . In some cases, msxml4.dll errors could indicate a [registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a [hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

## How to Fix Msxml4.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're listed below to try the more likely fixes first.

 Do not download msxml4.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[it's a bad idea to download DLL files](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) from sites like that. If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore msxml4.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" msxml4.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free data recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete this step, or any of the below steps, if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Download and install MSXML 4.0 SP3 from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36292) . This is the source of the DLL file and should be the only place you download msxml4.dll.  
 MSXML 4.0 isn't the newest version of MSXML, but it's the program necessary for replacing a missing or corrupt msxml4.dll file. MSXML 6.0, for example, though newer than v4.0, is necessarily if you're getting[errors about msxml6.dll](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-msxml6-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623825) .
3. [Reinstall the program that uses the msxml4.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the msxml4.dll error isn't resolved after installing MSXML, your next best option is to reinstall the program that's giving you the error message.  
 MSXML will put the msxml4.dll file in a_C:\\Windows\\_ subfolder. If the program that needs this DLL file doesn't look for it in that folder specifically, then reinstalling should reconfigure the program to either install a new version of msxml4.dll or copy it from the Windows folder. In other words, don't follow this step without first trying Step 2.
4. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some msxml4.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
5. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
6. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to msxml4.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file msxml4.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 This file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
7. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if msxml4.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
8. [Run the sfc/scannow System File Checker command](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161) to replace a missing or corrupt copy of the msxml4.dll file. Since this DLL is a Microsoft file, the[System File Checker](https://www.lifewire.com/sfc-command-system-file-checker-2626020) tool might restore it.
9. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other[patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The msxml4.dll file might be included in one of those updates.
10. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause DLL errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
11. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
12. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair msxml4.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid msxml4.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.
13. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the msxml4.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the msxml4.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
14. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any msxml4.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.

![msxml4.dll error message in Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6dZLoMkW383W92wwjgxnorf4xZ8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/msxml4-dll-error-message-5a7c98f9119fa8003701645a.png)

 There are several ways msxml4.dll errors can show up on your computer, such as:

* **Msxml4.dll Not Found**
* **This application failed to start because msxml4.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem**
* **Cannot find \[PATH\]\\msxml4.dll**
* **The file msxml4.dll is missing**
* **Cannot start \[APPLICATION\]. A required component is missing: msxml4.dll. Please install \[APPLICATION\] again**

 These error messages might appear while using or installing certain programs, when Windows starts or shuts down, or maybe even during a Windows installation.

 The context of the error is an important piece of information that will be helpful while solving the problem. The error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's [operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , including [Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) , ​[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) , [Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) , [Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) , [Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) , [Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and Windows 2000.
