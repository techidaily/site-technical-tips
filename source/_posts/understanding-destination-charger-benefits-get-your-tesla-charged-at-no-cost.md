 Whether you drive a Tesla or another kind of EV, you may benefit from Tesla's Destination charger network. But how does this differ from the Supercharger network, how much does charging cost, and where can you find a Destination charger near you?

##  What Are Tesla's Destination Chargers?

 Tesla offers two main kinds of public charger: Superchargers and Destination chargers. While Tesla's Superchargers can be accessed by anyone with a supported EV connector port, Destination chargers are a little more exclusive.

 The vast majority of Tesla Destination chargers can be found at hotels, malls, and restaurants, simply because these locations offer access to the chargers to customers only. These establishments pay to have Destination chargers installed, which are then offered to all customers with compatible EVs. If your EV has a Type 2 connector port, then you can use Tesla's Destination chargers.

 According to [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging), Destination chargers can add 44 miles of charge to your vehicle in an hour, and there are over 40,000 individual chargers to choose from around the world. The charging rate of Destination chargers is the same as that of a Tesla Wall Connector, which you can use at home.

 In fact, Tesla Destination chargers are essentially the same as Wall Connectors, with a 22 kW power output, as shown on the [Tesla Wall Connector webpage](https://www.tesla.com/en%5Fgb/support/charging/wall-connector).

 It's important to note, however, that Tesla Destination chargers and Superchargers are very different, so the [time it takes to charge your Tesla](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-unparalleled-free-console-reproduction-software-for-2024/) using each will differ. As [stated by Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging), a Supercharger can add 200 miles of charge to an EV in 15 minutes. In comparison, as Destination charger can only supply up to 44 miles of charge per hour, which equates to 11 miles in 15 minutes. To get 200 miles of charge, you'd have to have your car hooked up to a Destination charger for over 4.5 hours.

 But Destination chargers aren't designed for rapid charging, which is why they're located at malls, restaurants, and hotels. These chargers are there to charge your car at a slower pace over a longer period of time, such as overnight at a hotel or during a meal at a restaurant.

 Unlike Superchargers, Tesla's Destination chargers are usually completely free to use. As a customer courtesy, the establishment at which the chargers are located pays the charging cost on behalf of the user. Of course, the catch here is that you likely need to be a verified customer of the establishment, especially if the Destination chargers are in a gated area. For instance, to use a hotel's Destination charger, you may need to have checked in to your room first to prove that you're a paying customer.

 Additionally, businesses may require you to first pay for parking to use their Destination chargers, meaning they technically aren't totally free to use.

 While charging your Tesla using a Destination charger, you can check its progress on the Tesla mobile app. All you have to do is plug your EV in, and the charging begins.

 Tesla's Destination chargers can be found in much of the US and Western Europe, as well as Australia, Japan, the UAE, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand. There are certain locations in other countries, such as China and Iceland, but these are rarer, and are usually located in large cities.

 In the US, the vast majority of Tesla Destination chargers are located in the East, specifically along the East Coast. But you can also find a wide variety on the West Coast, and Mid-Western states, like Minnesota and Ohio. In certain states, there are far fewer Destination charging locations, specifically Nevada, Nebraska, and the Dakotas.

 To view a complete, up-to-date map of Tesla Destination charging locations, simply head to the [dedicated Tesla webpage](https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&bounds=45.04957416173191%2C-85.87718946701548%2C28.949650649740423%2C-127.01000196701548&zoom=6&filters=destination%20charger).
