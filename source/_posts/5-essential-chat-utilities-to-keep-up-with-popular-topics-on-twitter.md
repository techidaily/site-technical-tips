## What to Know About BlueStacks

 BlueStacks is an Android emulator that works on Windows and macOS. You have other options of Android emulators, but BlueStacks is one of the biggest and most popular choices.

 System requirements for BlueStacks aren't very strenuous, but you'll need at least 4GB of RAM (the developers recommend 8GB). Most CPUs will work just fine, unless you have an older, single-core laptop.

 BlueStacks also runs on macOS. Your Mac needs to run macOS Sierra (10.12) or higher and have an Intel Dual Core processor or better and at least 4GB of RAM.

 Because recent Macs and PCs are generally more powerful than phones, your device should easily meet even the more strenuous, recommended specs for Bluestacks. You likely won't even need to check whether you can run the program unless your computer is especially old.
