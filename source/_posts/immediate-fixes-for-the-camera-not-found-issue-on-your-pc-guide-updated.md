## Fix 1\. Allow your device to access your camera

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and type **camera privacy settings** .
2. Select **Camera privacy settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/win-11-camera-privacy-settings.jpg)
3. Make sure the option**Camera access** is turned on. If you don’t see it’s on, you can click the**Change** button to turn it on. Then you may want to go back to Device Manager, and check if the camera is there.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/camera-access-on-win-11.jpg)
4. But if the camera is turned on but you still can’t find the camera in Device Manager, you can skip to the next fix below to solve your problem.

## Fix 2\. Scan for hardware changes

 It’s possible that your computer already has the driver installed but the Windows system fails to detect the driver. Therefore, you can scan for hardware changes in Device Manager:

1. Open Device Manager.
2. Select**Cameras** (or Imaging devices/ USB devices) and click**Action** \>**Scan for hardware changes** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/scan.jpg)
3. If your webcam shows up, this means the driver has been successfully detected. Restart your computer for the changes to take full effect.

## Fix 3\. Update your device drivers

 The first thing is to make sure all your device drivers are up to date. Since you can’t update the driver right from the Device Manager ([learn why you can’t rely on Windows…](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website and install the latest webcam drivers (along with other device drivers).

### Option 1 – Manually

Let’s take Dell computers for an example:

1. Go to the[Dell Support](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fsupport%2Fhome%2Fen-us%3Fapp%3Dproducts) page. Then enter your product model to get all the related drivers in**Drivers & Downloads** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delldownload-1.jpg)
2. Download the driver you need and follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/driver.jpg)

 Of course, you can use their **[SupportAssist](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fsupport%2Fcontents%2Fen-us%2Farticle%2Fproduct-support%2Fself-support-knowledgebase%2Fsoftware-and-downloads%2Fsupportassist)**  to get the latest drivers and fix hardware issues, but this software can take up a lot of CPU, thus slowing down your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
