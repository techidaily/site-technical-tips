## Navigating Skype Interviews Like a Pro: The Ultimate Guide to Landing Roles
 Many companies use[Skype](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-skype-3426903) to handle job interviews. While it makes the interview simpler because you don't have to travel, it also creates new difficulties. If you're on the hunt for a new job and expect to do Skype interviews, these tips can help you look professional when it's time to chat with your potential future employers.

## Don't Leave Lights on Behind You

 You want your interviewer to see you, so don't sit with your back to a strong light. Your webcam will likely adjust to the lighting, and leave you looking like a mysterious silhouette. Your interviewers won't see your face or your mouth moving, and it won't help your chances of getting the job. Instead, turn toward the light source if you can, so your face and background are equally well lit.

## Use Headphones

 If you've been on the other end of a call and listened to everything you say echoed back to you, you know how frustrating it can be. Some[high-quality microphones](https://www.lifewire.com/condenser-and-dynamic-microphones-4142637) do a good job of preventing this. However, the easiest way to make sure you won't annoy your interviewers is by wearing a pair of headphones. Unless you have incredibly loud headphones, your microphone shouldn't pick up the audio coming from your interviewers.

## Dress for an Interview

 When you're interviewing on Skype, your interviewer may see nothing but your chest, shoulders, and face. Still, you should dress appropriately for the interview. Dress as if you were going into the company's office to meet your interviewer face-to-face. Wear dress pants or a conservative skirt because you may need to get up and move around during the chat. Shoes and socks are optional; if your feet end up on camera, something else has gone wrong.

## Be Mindful of Background Noise

 It's not just the echo of your interviewers' voices you have to worry about. Do your best to pick a quiet space, so the interviewers can hear you when you speak and don't hear a racket when they speak.

 This doesn't only mean you should find a space that's quiet at the moment you start the interview. It might be quiet in your living room, but street noise could suddenly flare up. If your family or roommates come home during your Skype interview, they can be a disruption. Also, avoid typing on the keyboard while on Skype, as the clicks are fairly audible.

 If you have a hard time finding somewhere perfectly quiet, use the Skype's mic Mute button when you're not talking.

## Make Sure Interviewers Have Your Contact Info

 You should give your interviewer your Skype[username](https://www.lifewire.com/create-perfect-screen-name-1949903) before you chat, and you should have a backup plan. No matter how well prepared you or your interviewers are, something could go wrong. In that case, be prepared to switch over to a regular phone interview. Making that switch is easier if you give the interviewers your phone number ahead of time so they can reach you if the Skype connection drops.

 Before you send an interviewer your Skype details, review your Skype username and profile. If you have a goofy username that you made up in high school, or you have profile details that you don't want potential employers to see, update these things or create a new Skype account for professional purposes.

## Don't Use Skype on Your Phone

![iPhone video chat](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RmBoVD46YAYfZsulVYC359aHOHk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-452412943-57bd2cc65f9b58cdfdd1920a.jpg)

 Your phone may be great for a lot of things, but it's not ideal for conducting an interview. Use the phone if you have no other option, but go with a computer if you can. The larger screen makes it easier for you to see your interviewer, and the higher, more stationary camera lets them get a better angle to see you.

 If you must use Skype on your phone, don't hold it in your hand. Find a stable place to set it, preferably at eye level. This eliminates camera shake and lets you move freely.

 A key component to using Skype online is being online.[Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430) ,[Bluetooth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412) , and mobile connections are more stable now than in the past, but wired connections are generally more reliable. If your computer can connect to the internet using an[Ethernet](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ethernet-3426740) cable, and if you have wired headphones, these are your best bets for a stable connection during your call.

 A cluttered background may distract your interviewer, and if it's a real mess, it may give them a bad impression. Ideally, find a place with a tidy and plain background so your interviewer can focus on you.

 The angle of your camera is also important, as you should try to get it level with your face. Avoid putting your computer in your lap with the webcam angled up. That's an easy way to give interviewers a view up your nose.

 The last thing you want to do is get on Skype minutes before a job interview and be unfamiliar with Skype. Even if you use the app for[conference calls](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-skype-3426903) regularly, do a test run with a friend before the interview to make sure everything looks good, sounds good, and works as intended.

 You should also make sure your[Skype software is updated](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-skype-4173260) and that you know your password. You don't want to start the app only to spend several minutes attempting to remember, recover, or reset your password.

 If you find anything wrong during your trial run, there are several ways to[fix Skype problems](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-skype-problems-4153434) .
