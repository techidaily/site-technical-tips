 The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has a new chip, the series S9 SiP (System in a Package), and a brighter screen (up to 3,000[ nits](https://www.lifewire.com/understanding-nits-lumens-brightness-4125499) over the initial Apple Watch Ultra's 2000 nits). The new, model-exclusive Modular Ultra face makes the most of the huge screen to make a lot of information available at a glance. Some examples are your Fitness rings, UV Index, Music, Workout info, and altitude.

 Apple also introduced a nifty double-tap feature that simulates a button push using your thumb and index fingers. (It's also available on the Series 9.)

 The Ultra 2 can detect your elevation from about -1,600 to 29,500 feet (-500 to 9000 meters). It's also water-resistant and dive-ready up to around 130 feet (40 meters). If you're diving, you can also log the depth, dive time, and water temperature to keep records of your activities.
