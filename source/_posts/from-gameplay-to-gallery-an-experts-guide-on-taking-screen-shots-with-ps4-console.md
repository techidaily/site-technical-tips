###  What to Know

* The quickest option: Press the Share button on your PlayStation 4 controller for one second to take a screenshot.
* Slower, but more useful: Tap the Share button briefly to summon the Share menu, where you can send a screenshot to social media.

##  How to Save a Screenshot to the PS4 

 This will save a screenshot to your PS4\. You can view it on the PlayStation 4 or transfer it to a USB storage device.

1. Find the**Share** button on the PlayStation 4 controller, which is located to the left of the touchpad and above the left thumbstick.  
 Press and hold it for one second. The PlayStation 4 will make a confirmation chime and display a camera icon on the left side of your display.
2. In the PlayStation 4’s home screen menu, navigate to the**Library** , which is always located all the way to the right. Select and open it.
3. The**Library** is sorted alphabetically by default, so the**Capture Gallery** will be near the top of the list. Select and open it.

4. The most recent screenshot will be located at the top of the**All** folder. Open that folder, which is the first listed, to find your screenshot.  
 You can view a screenshot by selecting and opening it. Once it’s open, you can zoom in and out, or make basic edits.

5. While it’s nice to view a screenshot in the Capture Gallery, you likely want to move or share it.  
 To do that, select the screenshot in the**Capture Gallery** and press the**Options** button on the PlayStation 4 controller. This opens a menu on the right-hand side. Make sure you have a USB storage device connected to one of the PlayStation 4’s[ USB ports](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166) , then select**Copy to USB storage device** .

6. The list of screenshots will now include checkboxes, with the screenshot you previously selected already checked. Select**Ok** .
7. A prompt will appear to tell you the folder directory where the screenshot will be saved. Select**Ok** and relax while the screenshot transfers.  
 Once transferred, screenshots can be found on the USB storage device in the folder directory**PS4/SHARE/Screenshots** .

##  Where to Find Older Screenshots 

 If you’re looking for an older screenshot, navigate to the folder corresponding to the game in which you took the screenshot, as you'll no longer have to wade through screenshots from every game.  

##  How to Share a Screenshot Directly to X 

 The prior steps cover the quickest way to take a screenshot on PS4, but not the quickest way to share a screenshot or move a screenshot to another device.

 Posting a screenshot to X, and then saving that screenshot to your computer or another device, is often quicker than using the USB storage transfer method described above.

1. Quickly tap the**Share** button on the PlayStation 4 controller. Don’t hold it down. This will open the PlayStation 4’s**Share** menu on the left-hand side of your display.
2. Select**Screenshot** , which is the second option from the top.

###  Special note  
 You can also select**Save Screenshot** from the Share menu to save it to the Capture Gallery.
3. You’ll now face a choice of the social media platform on which you’d like to share the screenshot. The only compatible social media platform for screenshots is**X** , so select that.
