![ebook subscription](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Ebook-subscription-service.png)Recently, Amazon announced that the June 2017 funding pool for Kindle Unlimited was $18million. This is not only a huge increase in money but also indicates more and more people spend their money on **eBook subscription service**. Although there are many companies that provide **eBook subscription service** and try to convince you that the ebook subscription service is the future trend of reading, not all of them can make it to the end. Websites like Oyster and Entitle can be shut down. No one can guarantee the future of the ebook subscription service. Choosing the **online book subscription** service can be challenging. In this article, we will review three best websites with ebook subscription service so that you can decide which one to choose. 

### Scribd vs. Kindle Unlimited vs. Kobo Plus

**General features comparison: Scribd vs. Kindle Unlimited vs. Kobo Plus**

| |  Scribd  | Kindle Unlimited                     | Kobo Plus                                                       |                                                            |

### Scribd

![scribd](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/scribd-2.png)Although, Scribd began as a documents sharing service, now it has its own massive library with huge amount of eBooks, audiobooks and news&magazines. Meanwhile, you can also browse the documents uploaded by users. 

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054" border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Each month, you will be given 3 credits for ebooks and 1 credit for auidobooks. By using these credits, you can pick up the three books and one audiobooks from Scribd library. Besides this, the editors will handpick a reotating collection of books and audiobooks for _Scribd Selects_ which you have unlimited access. To be mentioned, these books in _Scribd Select_ are not less popular read, but the best selling books and audiobooks in every genre. With the membership, you also have unlimited access to sheet music, documents and articles from top magazines. If you are a comic fan, you are able to browse a 10000-piece collection of comics throuh this service. The Scribd subscription service will allow you keep no more than 20 books in your account at one time.

Scribd is the best choice for those who have multiple read demands and interest in every digital reading material around the market. Unfortunately, Scribd only works on iOS and Android devices, but does not support e-ink ereaders. So if you want to read your ebooks on Kindle, Kobo or Nook, you may be disappointed. Another drawback to the Scribd is that it has less new release titles. Some time, it will take weeks to get the the new released titles avaible, or even longer.

### Kindle Unlimited

![kindle unlimited](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle-unlimited-2.png) Amazon is not the first website offering the ebook subscriotion service, but it is the biggest winner in this area. Now the Kindle Unlimited owns the largest market share in this field. I think the success of Kindle Unlimited mostly is relied on their massive titles which is over 1.4 million. Among the 1.4million titles, there are almost 20 thousand titles come with Audible Narration. The audiobooks are marked as "with narration" are free for Kinde Unlimited subscriber, but others are not. Thanks for _Whyispersyc for voice_ function, you can seamlessly switch between reading and listening. Like Scribd, it also gives access to magazine&news.

Most of the Kindle Unlimited books are published within the Amazon publishing ecosystem by self-publishing author. Major publishing house, Hachette, MacMillan, Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins, and Penguin, are not interested in Amazon's ebooks subscription platform because the Amazon requres the books in Kindle Unlimited are exclusive. Therefore, you will find few Kindle Unlimited books on the list of NewYork Times bestsellers. If you want to read the hottest bestsellers, Kindle Unlimited is not a good choice. If you are always willing to discover new authors and try out new genres, you should never miss out this service. With the new titles constantly added to the list, you will always find something new.

 Like other subscription, Kindle Unlimited subscription service will not allow you pack hundreds of Kindle Unlimited books. You can only keep up to 10 books from the Kindle Unlimited in your account at one time. The Kindle Unlimited books can be read on Kindle e-readers, Kindle apps for iOS and Android, Kindle Fire and Kinde desktop apps.

Kindle Unlimited subscription service is available in US, UK, Germany, France, Spain, India, China, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, and Austalia.

For more detailed informat about Kindle unlimited subscription service, please read the article [Kindle Unlimited Subscription](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) FAQ.

### Kobo Plus

![kobo plus](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Kobo-plus.png)After the Amazon launched the Kindle Unlimited, the Kobo has followed Amazon's step and set foot in ebook subscription service. On February 22, 2017, Kobo has launched **Kobo Plus**, a service that offers unlimited reading of eligible books. Kobo Plus jointly created by Kobo and online Dutch and Belgium retailer bol.com. For now, customers from Netherlands and Belguim can enjoy this service. 

The **Kobo Plus subscription** service offers more than 40000 titles at the launching--more than 30000 in English and 16000 in the Dutch language. There are also titles in other language, including German, Italian, Protuguese and Japanese. The catalog grows pretty quickly up to over 50000 publications a few months later. Since the Kobo Plus is developing in close collaboration with leading Dutch publisher, there are many attractive titles in the cataglog. For not, you can only find ebooks in the Kobo Plus library because audiobooks and magazines still have not been added to its catalog.

The Kobo Plus allow users to download no more than 15 books with one account which is 5 more than Kindle Unlimited. You are allowed to read these Kobo Plus books on Kobo ereader, Kobo tablets, Kobo APP for iOS, Android, or Kobo desktop app.

Anyway, if you are living in the Netherlands and Belguim and do not love other digital reading but ebooks, this is the best option for you. As we know, the Kindle Unlimited is still not launch in these two countries.

### Make Your Decision

After comparing three online book subscription services, it's time for you to decide which is the best ebook subscription and which one is the best for you. Since these three subscription services offer 30-days free trial, you can try them one by one and then decide which one suits you the best. 

As the real book lover, I am sure you do not only purchase books from one vendor, but you may just have one Kindle or Kobo. As we know that, every vendor employ different DRM scheme to encrypt their books. That means you will never have any chance to read a Kindle book in Kobo without the DRM removed. Here meet [Epubor Ultimate](https://www.epubor.com/)which can not only strip the DRM from ebooks purchased from Amazon, Kobo, Nook and GooglePlay but also convert the books to any other format. Just download it and have a free trial. It will surprise you.

Even cheaper - just $5.99 - is Angel Access at Naughty Angel Publishing. I love this ebook subscription service because I get free romance ebooks every day and I get to keep the books. Worth adding to your list!
