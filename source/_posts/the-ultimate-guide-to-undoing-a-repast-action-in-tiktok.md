2. Tap**Share** (the right arrow).
3. Tap**Remove repost** . You'll see a brief confirmation message.

##  What Happens When You Unrepost a TikTok? 

 Videos you repost are more likely to appear in your followers' feeds. So, when you undo a repost on TikTok, the video will no longer be in their feeds unless they stumble upon it organically.

 Deleting a repost doesn't delete the original video. Only your repost is removed. You won't see how many likes and comments your repost got, but the original video will retain your followers' likes and comments.
