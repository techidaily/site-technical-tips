### What to Know

* On your iPhone, tap**Settings** \>**Messages** \>**Text Message Forwarding** \>_your iPad_ \>**On** .
* No iPhone? Tap**Settings** \>**Messages** \>**Send & Receive** and then select an email to use instead.
* Or, try a messaging service like Skype, Messenger, or Viber, or a free texting app like FreeTone.

 This article explains how to route texts from your[iPad](https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-ipad-models-and-generations-1994232) through an iPhone using the Continuity feature. If you don't have an iPhone, there are a few workarounds for sending texts from your iPad.

 Make sure you're signed in to your iPad and iPhone with the same Apple ID to enable text forwarding.

## How to Set up Text Forwarding

 When you set up text forwarding between your iPad and iPhone, you can text people from your iPad even if they have an Android device or a phone without smart features.

 The iPad uses a feature called Continuity to route the message through the cloud to your iPhone and then to the recipient.

 Here's how to set up the text forwarding feature on an iPhone.

1. On the iPhone, go to**Settings** \>**Messages** .
2. Tap**Text Message Forwarding** .
3. This screen lists the Apple devices you own that can use the Continuity feature. Tap the toggle switch**On** beside your iPad to enable text message forwarding for it.

4. You are prompted to type a code on the iPad to activate the feature. After you type the code, your iPad can send text messages to both iPhone users and non-iPhone users.  
 The iPad uses the same stickers, animations, and drawings that are included with the iPhone text messaging app.[Upgrade to the latest operating system](https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-iphones-operating-system-2000293) to ensure you have the recent features.

## How to Text on Your iPad if You Don't Own an iPhone

 If you don't own an iPhone, there are several ways to use your iPad to send text messages. Use Apple's service, alternatives to text messaging, or one of the apps that provide free SMS messaging on the iPad.

### Messages App

 The Messages app can send text messages to anyone who owns an iPhone or iPad, even if you don't own an iPhone.

 The iPad uses your Apple ID to route the message based on the email address associated with your Apple ID account. If the recipient doesn't own an iPhone but owns an iPad, they need to turn on this feature.

 To turn on this feature, tap**Settings** \>**Messages** \>**Send & Receive** . The iPad lists the email accounts associated with your Apple ID. Tap to put a check mark next to the email addresses you want to use.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Facebook Messenger

 If you have friends or family that use Android or a Windows Phone, send them messages using the Facebook Messenger app. Anyone who has a Facebook account can be reached via Facebook Messenger.

### Skype

 Skype allows you to use your iPad as a phone. In addition to sending text messages, you can send video messages, place phone calls, and video conference. If you want to stay in touch with someone and can't use Messages because they don't own an iOS device, Skype is a great alternative.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Snapchat

 Snapchat works on the iPad. However, you'll jump through a hoop to install it.

 Because there isn't an official iPad version, when you search for Snapchat in the app store, tap**iPad Only** at the top of the search screen in the App Store and choose**iPhone** to search for iPhone-only apps.

 Snapchat isn't true text messaging because you can only message people who signed up for the service, but it offers a fun alternative to traditional text messaging.

### Viber

 Viber has all the bells and whistles you would expect in a social messaging service, including Viber Wink, which deletes the message after it is viewed.

 You can also place phone calls and video calls and get involved in public chats. Viber also supports[split-view multitasking](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-ipad-split-screen-4687495) .

### More Free Texting Apps

 FreeTone (formerly Text Me) and textPlus offer free texting to iPad users. FreeTone offers users a free phone number capable of sending SMS messages to the U.S., Canada, and 40 other countries.

 Both FreeTone and textPlus allow phone calls in addition to text messages, but you may need to pay for in-app purchases to use all of the features.
