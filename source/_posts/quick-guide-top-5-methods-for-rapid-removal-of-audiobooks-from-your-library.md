When we've finished one audible book and then don't want to listen to it again, we can choose removing it from our devices. Another reason we want to delete Audible books is, if you had 300+ audible books on an iPhone, you would want to free up your iPhone storage space so that you can download another valuable item, right?

This article will introduce 5 methods to delete audio books from audible quickly. Follow the instructions below and identify your need to choose the one.

### Delete Audible books by hidding finished titles

There will be some audible books that you're sure you won't see them for a long time, but you don't wish them to be deleted altogether from your device. Then you can choose to hide them in your device.

(Take Audible for iPad app as an example)

Firstly, open the Audible app on your iPad.

Then, tap on "Device", you are now at audible library. Choose the book you want to hide and open it. 

![delete audible books by hidding](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-audible-books-by-hidding.png)

Tap the overflow menu (three dots) to the right of your selected audiobook.

Tap "Mark as Finished". 

Tap the "filter" icon from the left area. By default this is set to "All title", if you click on it then from the dropdown menu you will see "Unfinished". 

![filter finished audible books to delete](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/mark-audible-books.jpg)

Tap it and back to the home library, you will see that the marked audible files are not shown up. You could skip the one you hate and keep listening what you like. 

**Please Note:** If you uninstalled the Audible app, all your previously downloaded audiobooks including the titles that marked as "Finished" will be removed. Though bookmarks and synced audio position for the removed audible files will return after you re-installing and downloading those titles, but anything marked as "Finished" will not. You should retag them.

The same feature on Android, steps will be a little different but nearly the same, just use the filter option and select "Hide finished title".

Here take my Kindle Fire HD as an example to show you how to delete Audible books from Kindle eReaders and tablets devices.

By default, downloaded audible audiobooks will be saved under the "Device" or "Downloaded" tab from the "My Library" screen.

Tap on "Device" or "Downloaded", then press and hold the title which you want to remove for one or two seconds. When a new small window pops up, tap "Remove from Device" options please. 

Another simple way you can use is connecting your Kindle devices to your computer via USB.

Just delete those files from "Audible" folder. Done.

Don't worry that both methods only help remove audible contents from your local device, you won't miss them and whenever you want to listen to them again you can re-download those titles.

### Delete audio books from iPhone/iPad/android Audible app

#### Delete Audible books from android

How do we delete audible books that we no longer want on our android? 

The first method is directly deleting from Audible app. Just open Audible app and open the audible library. 

You will see all your audiobooks in the library. Perform a long tap on the audiobook or click the three dots on the right side of the chosen book, then you will see a drop down menu, from which select "Remove from Device" to tap, done.

![delete audible from android](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-audible-from-android.jpg)

To delete audible books from android, you can also try to delete them directly from the local drive by connecting to the computer.

**Please note:** If your android phone is using the newest OS Kitkat 4.4, you need to use a third-party app named "ES File Explorer Manager" from the Play Store. Tap it and select “extSdCard” -- “Audible" -- "Delete" -- "OK". But remember that this will remove the whole audible folder and all your audible books will be removed. If you just want to remove several books from Android Kitkat 4.4, you should [remove DRM and convert audible books to mp3](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/audible-converter/) to back up first. 

#### Delete Audible books from iphone/ipad/ipod

We can delete audio books from the IOS audible app. 

Open Audible app and open "My Library". If you opened one audiobook, you can find the "My Library" at the bottom-left corner of the screen. 

Touch "Delete" button near the top screen. You will see a red circle on the left side of the audiobook cover. Tap read circle that you want to delete. 

![delete audible from ios devices](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-audible-from-ios.jpg)

From the right side, you will see a red "Remove" button. Confirm "Remove".

You can also go to "Setting" -- "General" -- "Usage" -- "Manage Storage" -- "Music", then locate the audiobook and choose the one you want to remove. This is also very easy and no needs to use a computer but just with our device.

#### Delete Audible books from computer 

We can delete from Audible Manager. Audible Manager helps us save downloaded ADH audio files as AA/AAX, so if we could find the aa/aax location, we can directly delete the downloaded titles to remove audible audiobooks.

(Windows 7/8/10) _C:\\Users\\username\\documents\\audible\\programs\\downloads_

(Win 10 Audible app) _C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\AudibleInc.AudibleforWindowsPhone\_...\\LocalState\\Content_

Deleting audible files from Win 10 can use the Audible app. Deleting directly from audible app will also help you. 

### Delete Audible books from iTunes

Removing audible books from iTunes will help you delete them from your iPad/ iPod/ iPhone/ Mac computer when you sync.

Open iTunes. Choose "Audiobooks" section, right-click the audio book you want to remove. 

![delete from itunes library](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-from-library.png)

From the new menu please select "Delete from library".

You may receive a prompt says "Are you sure you want to delete the selected audiobooks from your iTunes library?". 

Click on "Delete Audiobooks".

![delete audible books from iTunes](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-audio-books-from-itunes.png)

**Please Note:** Audible audiobooks deleted from iTunes will also be removed from any of Apple devices that synchronizes with your iTunes library. 

### Delete Audible books from library/cloud

You will discover that those deleted audible files will still in your cloud or library. If you want to delete them permanently, for any reason, please visit Amazon official site on your computer with a browser and log in to your Amazon account.

Go to the "Manage Your Content and Devices" page, choose "Your Content" area, here you will see there was a button that says "Books".

Click "Books" to reveal more options and select "Audiobooks" from the drop down menu. Then you will see your audible books library. Select titles you want to remove and click on the yellow button "Delete".

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
A new window will pop up to tip you that are you sure. "Yes delete permanently". It may take a coupon of seconds for your action to reflect in your library.

![yes delete audible permanently](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/yes-delete-audible-permanently.png)

**Please note:** This method only works when your Audible account is linked to your Amazon account. 

If your Audible account is not associated with Amazon account, (most of us use seperate, right?), you should contact Audible customer center to solve the problem. I've tried to contact them and I was told to exchange my purchased titles to another audible books. If neither of the suggested solution we like, how to delete audible from cloud? No, **Audible don't allow us to delete files permanently by ourselves**!

Though I'm not so satisfied with their answer but I could understand that, maybe they just worry if sometimes we want to listen to the previously purchased audiobook but we've moved it out then we should buy the title again. To avoid this problem or more like this, I will recommend use this tool, [Epubor Audible Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/audible-converter/), to back up purchased audible books, as it helps us [convert audible aa/aax to common MP3](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

And how do I transfer all my bookmarks from my old phone to my new phone? Or even how do I save them on the cloud?

if you go on Audible's desktop site, you can go to your library and play it. A cloud player will appear and it will link to your device, retrieving all of your bookmarks. You can easily copy and paste your bookmarks from there, and it will also copy links to clips. Hope that makes sense.

Is there any way, in Kindle Cloud Reader (on my pc), to remove the "audible portion" from a Kindle Book (which allowed free inclusion of "AUDIBLE" for the book), while retaining the underlying Kindle Book?  
 I don't wish to say goodbye to the Kindle book,   
 but for whatever reason, I cannot, if a Kindle book INCLUDES AUDIBLE, read the book using the Kindle Cloud Reader.  
 Can you tell me how I could actually contact Amazon Customer Support?? (I'm pretty sure they make it very difficult to find out how!!) They provide lots of answers, but I don't think they have MY answer.

 It seems we can not offer you the solution to your issue.

I don't understand your system. I always end up with books that are charged to me. I can't pay these fines. It is best o delete and go back to Thriftbooks.
