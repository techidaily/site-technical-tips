Google Books offers millions of excellent books over the world and sometimes we can read them online for free. However, it's difficult for us to read Google Books offline if we don't get the downloaded books. It's not really a comfortable way to view books in front of the desktop computer. E-Book reader devices (Kindle, Apple, Nook, Kobo) give us a pleasant reading experience. 

So is it possible to download google books to a local hard drive and transfer Google books to an eReader? Don't worry, this guide will teach you two methods to **download google books.**

###  1\. Download Books from Google Books

You can download free books or magazines on Google Books. Here is the easiest way for you.

Step 1 Go to Google Books

Open your brower and go to the page of Google Books: <https://books.google.com/>. Type a book title to search the book.

Step 2 Search for free Google eBooks 

In the search results, click **"Any books"** at the top and tap **"Free Google eBooks"**. Then all the free google books of the book tile will be listed. Just choose one to preview the book online.

Step 3 Download PDF/EPUB Google books 

On the top right, click the gear button. Then you will see **"Download EPUB"** and **"Download PDF".** Just choose one format you'd like to download the book.

###  2\. Download Books from Google Play

If you couldn't find the book you want in Google books, you would probably find it in Google Play Books. As the competitor of Kindle, Kobo books, Google Play Books claims it to be the largest ebooks collection in the world by offering over five million titles. You can not only download free books from Google play, but also purchase a book here.

Step 1 Go to Google Play Books Store

First[go to Google Play Books Store](https://play.google.com/store/books) and log in with your Google account. You will see all your Google Play books added to your library when you click "My Books" on the top left side

Step 2 Choose the book to download

Under each book cover, click on the three dots button and then select EPUB or PDF formats to download the book.

If the book is DRM free, you will get an real EPUB or PDF ebook, and it's very easy to read them anywhere you like.

**But if the book is DRM-protected, you will get an .acsm file. You need to [remove the DRM from Google Play Books in acsm format](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) and convert acsm to real ebook format, otherwise the downloaded file is useless for you.**

Here [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), the best **Google books DRM removal tool** and ebook converter, can help you remove DRM from Google Play books and convert the ebook format to mobi/epub/azw3/pdf.
