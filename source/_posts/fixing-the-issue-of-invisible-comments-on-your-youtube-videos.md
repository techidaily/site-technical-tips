## Fixing the Issue of Invisible Comments on Your YouTube Videos

Close 

 This article explains what might be preventing YouTube comments from appearing for you, either as a viewer or as a channel, and what you can do to fix the issue.

##  Why Is YouTube Not Showing Comments? 

 Here are some reasons you can't see comments on YouTube:

* The page didn't load correctly
* Comments are intentionally disabled or removed
* Your internet connection is too slow
* There's a browser extension conflict
* Your browser or app has a bug
* YouTube is having problems displaying comments

##  How to Fix YouTube Comments Not Showing Up 

 Follow these suggestions in the order they're listed to try the easier solutions first:

1. Reload the page or reopen the app. A temporary hiccup could be the reason comments aren't showing, and a refresh is a simple way to test that. Depending on where you're watching the video, you can reload the web page by clicking the refresh button near the URL or closing and reopening the video.
2. [ Clear your browser's cache](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-cache-2617980) . A corrupt or outdated cache can cause all kinds of problems with how the page is displayed. Purge the cache, per the directions in that link, and then repeat Step 1 to see if the YouTube comments show up.  
 Follow these directions if you're using the YouTube app: Android \[[ Clear Android Cache](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-cache-android-4157780) \] or iOS \[[ Clear iPhone Cache](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-iphone-cache-4178428) \].
3. Make sure comments are enabled for the video in the first place. A creator, or even YouTube itself, may disable comments for a video. If this is the case, you should see a message indicating that, such as “Comments are turned off." This is the most likely case if other videos from different creators_do_ have comments.  
 If this is your channel that has no comments,[ open YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com/) and go to**Settings** \>**Community** \>**Defaults** to check your settings.  
![Comment settings for a YouTube channel](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u34Cgu0xytzQBLqFE406hAsNG_w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/youtube-comments-settings-9e4d0be80f6a4a2eb28d5a174ab798c3.png)
4. Check your internet connection. If it's too weak, it's possible that not everything on the page loaded, leaving you with missing comments. If you suspect this,[ consider addressing network lag](https://www.lifewire.com/lag-on-computer-networks-and-online-817370) .  
 Pay close attention to the way the page loads. If it takes longer than usual or if one or parts of the page appear out of place, there's a good chance the network is to blame.
5. [ Disable browser extensions](https://www.lifewire.com/disable-chrome-extensions-and-plugins-4136252) that could be interfering with YouTube. You don't have to delete them; just switch them off and then check if the comments came back.  
 Be sure to complete this step if YouTube stopped showing comments shortly after you installed a new extension, especially one that's designed to change YouTube's website in some way.
6. Update your browser or app. These should be updated as frequently as possible to address bugs, one of which could be the reason YouTube is not showing comments.  
 For a computer browser, open the menu to find an About or Help section; this is usually where update opportunities are shown. Visit the app store on your phone or tablet to update YouTube's mobile app: Android \[[ Update Android Apps](https://www.lifewire.com/update-apps-on-android-7106106) \] or iOS \[[ Update iPhone Apps](https://www.lifewire.com/ways-to-keep-iphone-apps-to-date-2000645) \].
7. Reboot your device. It's easy to restart a computer \[[ Reboot Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) \] or an Android \[[ Reboot Android](https://www.lifewire.com/reboot-android-smartphone-or-tablet-4127180) \] or iOS \[[ Reboot iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restart-iphone-2000288) \] device.
8. Check if YouTube is having issues. There isn't a web page you can visit to see if YouTube's comments section is down, but you can check social media websites for any mention of a bug causing the comments to disappear.[ Downdetector is another way to monitor YouTube problems](https://downdetector.com/status/youtube/) .  
 There's a good chance, however, that a problem with a site as big as YouTube will get fixed relatively quickly, so you could also just wait it out.
9. YouTube may have automatically marked some of your videos as being “for kids,” which disables comments following COPPA guidelines. If your video is_not_ made for kids, you can restore comments through[ YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com/) .  
 Through that link, click**Content** , then choose the video that's missing comments. Select**Details** on the video page and select**No, it's not made for kids** .  
 If it's common for you to not see comments on your YouTube videos, it's possible that your whole channel is designated as one made for kids. In YouTube Studio, go to**Settings** \>**Channel** \>**Advanced settings** , and then pick an appropriate setting, such as**No, set this channel as not made for kids** .
10. YouTube deletes comments that violate their Community Guidelines. If you can't see a comment you left on a YouTube video, their automatic detection system could have deleted it or someone might have reported your comment.

 FAQ

* Why are my YouTube comments appearing on other websites?  
 This is most likely due to Google searches, which can link to the comments you leave on a YouTube video when your name is queried. You can[ ask Google to remove the results](https://www.lifewire.com/you-can-now-ask-google-to-remove-personal-info-from-searches-5270380) , but it probably won't take action if the information being shared isn't deemed sensitive. If you want to prevent your comments from appearing elsewhere online, your best option is to delete them at the source.
* Why can't I see some replies to my YouTube comment?  
 It's most likely that YouTube has flagged some replies as spam or inappropriate, and has hidden them automatically. Comments that have been flagged like this can be un-hidden by the video's uploader at their discretion.
* Why do my YouTube comments disappear when I'm logged out?  
 When you're logged in YouTube will prioritize your own comments in a video's history for you, but when logged out it won't give them priority—likely resulting in them being pushed further down the page. If you just left a comment, try reorganizing the section with most recent comments first to see if that makes yours easier to find. If you can see your comments on a video when logged in, but not on the same video when logged out, it's also possible that the video uploader has chosen to hide your comments.
