Right now, the shopping giant is offering an incredible sale on the new-in-box [M1 MacBook Air](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage%2F609040889&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) for $649, just in time for back to school, and right on time for the [Walmart Deals event](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/get-a-walmart-membership-for-half-off-right-now-heres-how/).

This is the 2020 version of Apple's hugely popular lighter-than-air [laptop](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/) series that still packs a punch today with great battery life, bright display, and 8GB of memory all in the ultra-portable and lightweight design that the series is known for. The MacBook Air with Apple's first-generation Silicon chip still holds its own in 2024, especially at this price point.

We reviewed the [M1 MacBook Air](https://www.zdnet.com/video/m1-macbook-air-review-impressive-but-my-intel-macbook-pro-is-better/) back in 2020, and then [again in 2022](https://www.zdnet.com/article/m1-macbook-air-long-term-review/), and concluded that the fan-favorite laptop still holds up as a solid mobile workstation with a host of useful features.

The [M1 MacBook Air](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmacbook-air-13-3-laptop-apple-m1-chip-8gb-memory-256gb-ssd-space-gray-space-gray%2F5721600.p%3FskuId%3D5721600&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) first retailed for $999 when it was released, but Apple sells refurbished versions for $799, making these deals even better than anything Apple is offering. The [M1 MacBook Air](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage%2F609040889&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) is available in three different colors: gold, space gray, and silver.

## When will this deal expire?

Walmart's new partnership with Apple allows them to sell computers and laptops directly to customers, a first for the retailer. As such, there's no expiration date for the M1 MacBook Air for $649, but they almost certainly won't stay in stock long at this price. Similarly, Best Buy's $699 price has potential to sell out quick, too. 

However, deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings.
