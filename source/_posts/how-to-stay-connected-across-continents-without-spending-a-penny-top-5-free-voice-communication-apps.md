 What We Like

* Free voice and video calls.
* Group calling available.
* End-to-end encryption.

 What We Don't Like

* Frequent use could cause data overage.
* Encryption only if both parties have right version of app.
* No emergency calling.

[ WhatsApp](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-whatsapp-all-about-4781062) is a messaging and voice call app for Android and iOS that uses data, not your cellular plan. You can make voice and video calls to people all over the world for free, though you need to keep an eye on your data usage each month. The app also supports group calls.

 In 2016, WhatsApp added end-to-end encryption that applies to all messages and calls using the app. However, if you’re chatting with someone who has an older version, none of your communications are encrypted.

 There are also web and desktop versions of WhatsApp. You can’t use it to call emergency services such as 911 in the U.S.

**Download For:** 

[ iOS ](https://apps.apple.com/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997) 

[ Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp)
