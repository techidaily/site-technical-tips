 What We Like

* Free voice and video calls.
* Group calling available.
* End-to-end encryption.

 What We Don't Like

* Frequent use could cause data overage.
* Encryption only if both parties have right version of app.
* No emergency calling.

[ WhatsApp](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-whatsapp-all-about-4781062) is a messaging and voice call app for Android and iOS that uses data, not your cellular plan. You can make voice and video calls to people all over the world for free, though you need to keep an eye on your data usage each month. The app also supports group calls.

 In 2016, WhatsApp added end-to-end encryption that applies to all messages and calls using the app. However, if you’re chatting with someone who has an older version, none of your communications are encrypted.

 There are also web and desktop versions of WhatsApp. You can’t use it to call emergency services such as 911 in the U.S.

**Download For:** 

[ iOS ](https://apps.apple.com/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997) 

[ Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp) 

[ WhatsApp on the Web ](https://web.whatsapp.com/)

 What We Don't Like

* Risk of data overage.
* Doesn’t use end-to-end encryption.

[ Skype](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-skype-3426903) is a VoIP service that’s been around since 2003 and has always been an easy way to make free national and international calls. You can use it for voice and video calls, as well as group calls with up to 100 participants for free when communicating with other Skype users.

 Charges apply if you contact someone outside of Skype, but the company is upfront about the rates, and unlimited monthly packages are available.

 Like WhatsApp and other services that use data, you can’t use Skype to contact emergency services, since they can’t accurately pinpoint your location. In addition to Android and iOS, you can also make international calls from your PC or Mac computer, web browser, and even Xbox.
