##  When Will the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Be Released?

 The Pixel Buds Pro 2 release date is currently unknown.[ 9to5Google was the first to report on the possibility of a Buds Pro 2](https://9to5google.com/2024/03/01/45mm-pixel-watch-3-pixel-buds-pro-2/) , and we're discussing it now because it's been a couple of years since the originals came out in July 2022\. This period of time suggests that the second-generation buds might be coming soon.

 Google has made three variants of the Pixel Buds, but only the original has seen a second generation, which the company waited 1.5 years for. If we assume the same timeline for the Buds Pro, Google could come out with the next Pixel Buds Pro in late 2024 or early 2025.

###  Lifewire's Release Date Estimate

 The Pixel Buds Pro 2 could arrive as early as August 2024 with the[ Pixel 9](https://www.lifewire.com/google-pixel-9-8630767) .

##  Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Price Rumors

 Google originally listed the Pixel Buds Pro for $199.99\. As much as we'd like to see a cheaper pair this time, remember that the Pixel Buds A-Series is just $99\. So, the lowest we can see Google taking these Pro-level earbuds is $149.99\. If we had to guess, though, the $199.99 price is more likely.

##  Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Features & Hardware

 Google has kept quiet about these earbuds, leaving everyone to speculate about their features. After doing some research, these are a few features Pixel Buds fans are hoping to see in these new buds:

* **Better fit** : This is a huge complaint among existing Pixel Buds Pro wearers, with many wishing Google would return to the[ A-Series](https://www.lifewire.com/google-pixel-buds-a-series-5185971) design since tasks as simple as chewing can cause them to fall out.
* **Bigger battery** :[ 91mobiles spotted some info on the Buds Pro 2 charging case](https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-charging-case-battery-leaked/) that reveals a slight bump in battery capacity. The change from 620mAh to 650mAh should mean you can use the earbuds longer before they die.
* **Audio quality improvements** : A given with any earbuds upgrade is audio quality changes to provide a richer, clearer, and more immersive listening experience. Improvements could include increased clarity of ambient noise or the ability to better focus on specific sounds like conversations.
* **aptX Bluetooth codec support** : Including the[ aptX Bluetooth codec](https://www.lifewire.com/aptx-bluetooth-codec-4151667) would allow for higher-quality wireless audio transmission, especially for music and movies, by reducing audio lag and improving sound detail.
* **Better iOS compatibility** : While you can[ use Pixel Buds with an iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/use-pixel-buds-with-iphone-5190520) , they're very obviously designed to work better on Android. Google could attract iPhone fans by offering improved pairing speed and an app for editing settings and updating firmware.

 One thing we've heard from multiple sources, though, says that the new Pixel Buds Pro will be available in new colors. According to[ a post from leaker Dylan Roussel](https://x.com/evowizz/status/1810758546457346542) , the new hues will be Haze (gray), Mojito (green), Porcelain (tan), and Raspberry (pink):
