## Guide on Viewing Spider-Man: No Pathway Home Online

Close 

###  What to Know

* _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ is not currently streaming on any subscription services, but you can rent or buy it.
* Expect it to eventually appear on Disney+.

_Spider-Man: No Way Home_ is a massive crossover event for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) that brings together heroes and villains from both Sam Raimi’s_Spider-Man_ trilogy starring Tobey Maguire and the_Amazing Spider-Man_ films starring Andrew Garfield.  

##  How to Watch ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ Online 

_Spider-Man: No Way Home_ was streaming on Starz, but it's no longer available there. We expect it will eventually make its way to Disney+ to slot into the current "Multiverse Saga" (and so you can watch it right after its predecessors,_Homecoming_ and_Far From Home_ ), but that hasn't happened yet.

 The best way currently to watch_No Way Home_ is to rent or buy it.

##  Is ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ Streaming on Disney Plus? 

 Unfortunately,_Spider-Man: No Way Home_ is not available on Disney Plus and won’t be for some time.

 Unlike[ other entries in the MCU](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-marvel-movies-in-order-online-5077381) , Sony owns the movie rights to the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies. Since 2013, Starz holds a first-run film[ licensing agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment](https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press%5Freleases/2013/02%5F13/021113%5Fstarz.html) , which is why_Spider-Man: No Way Home_ dropped on its streaming service first.

 The good news is[ Sony and Disney struck a deal in April 2021](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/disney-sony-marvel-spiderman-movie-deal-1234957207/) to bring Sony movies to Disney+, but only[ after a first run on Netflix](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/netflix-sony-pictures-pay-1-starz-output-1234946413/) . Under this new agreement, we should eventually see all past and present Spider-Man movies hit Disney+.
