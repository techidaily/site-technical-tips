## Exploring the Ultimate Portable Music Player Selection - Insights

Remember MP3 players? Long before we had everything we needed on our phones, we had a portable player to listen to our music. In the history of portable audio players, there were Sony Walkmans, followed by CD players, and finally, the MP3 player dominated the early 2000s -- especially with the debut of the iPod in 2001.

It may surprise you that MP3 players (also known as digital audio players or DAPs) are still very much around in 2024\. The MP3 players of today sync to streaming services like Spotify, sport color and touchscreen displays, and offer expansive storage options. And while you may be listening to them with [wireless earbuds](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-wireless-earbuds/)instead of corded ones, they offer a sense of nostalgia while still giving us the advantages of today's tech.

### Best MP3 player overall

Sony Walkman players may look a little different than you're used to, but this Walkman still functions the same as Walkmans of the past -- just with a modern edge. It has an LCD display with up to 18GB of memory, and if that's not enough, you can expand up to 32GB with an SSD card. 

Sony says it uses artificial intelligence to enhance the quality of compressed digital music files, uses S-Master HX technology to reduce distortion, and employs a reflow solder to improve sound localization. 

**Also:** **[Sony has a new Walkman. That might be a bigger deal than you realize](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sony-has-a-new-walkman-that-might-be-a-bigger-deal-than-you-realize/)**

The player also has High-Resolution Audio, which captures and reproduces digital audio at a higher rate than CD to get you closer to the original studio recording. You can access apps like Spotify or Apple Music via Wi-Fi, or connect it to a PC to access your music collection.

[Reddit users](https://www.reddit.com/r/walkman/comments/11xmj1e/sony%5Fnw%5Fa306%5Fis%5Fso%5Fhard%5Fto%5Ffind%5Fis%5Fit%5Fworth%5Fit/) praise the long battery life and say that the Walkman's quality is such a step up from a smartphone that it's worth the buy.

## Mighty 3 Spotify Music Player

### Best mini MP3 player

This compact MP3 player from Mighty is reminiscent of Apple's popular iPod Shuffle and works similarly but is more 2024-friendly. You use the Mighty app to sync your Spotify or Amazon Music playlists wirelessly. Mighty Vibe's Stay Fresh feature automatically syncs these playlists while you sleep, so you always have up-to-date tracks.

A clip-on design makes this MP3 player perfect for running or working out. Plus, it's rated IPX4 to resist splashes of water or sweat. It works with both Bluetooth headphones and wired headphones, although some users report that wired headphones sound better. 

Verified customers like the ease of use of the Mighty 3 and note that it's super durable.

## Fiio M11S

### Best lossless audio MP3 player

Lossless audio has risen in popularity in recent years thanks to Apple's implementation of the technology in Apple Music. This MP3 player from Fiio is perfect for lossless audio tracks thanks to a custom-made chip, which provides lower noise floor and distortion. 

The player comes with Android 10 right out of the box so that you can access the Play Store and whatever streaming app is your go-to. It uses Bluetooth 5.0 technology, and when set into Bluetooth receiver mode, it becomes a high-quality Bluetooth amplifier with better frequency response. 

[Reddit users](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiiO/comments/17sp3wu/is%5Ffiio%5Fm11s%5Fworth%5Fit/) recommend using cable headphone to get the best sound out of it, but note that even the Bluetooth sound via LDAC is much better compared to a smartphone.

**Fiio M11S specs: Storage:** 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage | **Battery:** 13 hours | **Display:** 5.15-inch bezel-less (1440 x 720) touchscreen | **Media types:** WAV, FLAC, WMA, MP3, OGG, APE, AAC, ALAC, AIFF, DFF, DSF, DXD

## Which MP3 player is right for you?

The right MP3 player for you will depend on how much storage you need, what audio files you want to upload, if you need something simple or high-end, and what price you're willing to spend. 

Below, I've broken down the options further. 

| **Choose** **this** **MP3** **player...** | **If** **you** **want...**                                                                                                |

## Factors to consider when choosing an MP3 player:

There are several considerations to keep in mind before purchasing an MP3 player.

* **Storage:** The amount of storage in an MP3 player will ultimately determine how many songs it can hold, so pay attention to devices with lots of storage space. For example, 16GB of memory equates to about 4,000 songs.
* **Media types:** While MP3 players of course take MP3 files, consider devices that support additional file types, including WMA, WAV, AAC, and more.
* **Battery:** The great thing about modern-day MP3 players is that they will have much better battery lives than the devices of the past. The average battery life for a good MP3 player will be about 12 hours.
* **Price:** MP3 players vary greatly in price, from budget-friendly picks to expensive ones built for audiophiles.

## How did we choose these MP3 players?

When choosing the best MP3 players, we do extensive research into different products and brands, taking into consideration user reviews (both good and bad), competitor analysis, and more.

## How many songs does an MP3 player hold?

This all depends on the amount of storage that is on the MP3 device. The number of songs an MP3 player can hold will also depend on a song's file format and compression rate, so these numbers may vary. Here is a quick guide for reference of how many songs typical storage types can hold: 

* 4GB = 1,000 songs
* 8GB = 2,000 songs
* 16GB = 4,000 songs
* 32GB = 8,000 songs
* 64GB = 16,000 songs

## Is it worth it to buy an MP3 player?

In 2024, you might wonder if it's even worth buying an MP3 player when you can just listen to music on your smartphone. However, MP3 players are great for kids who want to listen to music but don't yet have a smartphone, people who like to run or hike outside, or those who simply want to listen to music without any distractions from their phones.

## What are the different audio formats?

Many MP3 players today support multiple audio files. Here are the most popular ones you'll see and what they mean: 

* **WAV:** A lossless audio format for studio recording larger than MP3 files.
* **FLAC:** A lossless format that maintains excellent sound quality, even though the files are compressed.
* **WMA:** A Windows-based MP3 alternative.
* **AAC:** Provides high-quality sound thanks to advanced audio coding.
* **OGG**: A Spotify-specific audio format.

## Do MP3 players need Wi-Fi?

No. Because MP3 players don't need Wi-Fi to work, you can use them in more situations. However, some MP3 players do have Wi-Fi connection capabilities, such as the Mighty Vibe player.

## Are there alternative MP3 players worth considering?

Of course, there are plenty of other MP3 players outside of these four options. Here are some other products I think are worth looking into.
