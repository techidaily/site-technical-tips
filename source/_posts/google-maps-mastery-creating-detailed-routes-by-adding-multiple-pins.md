Close 

###  What to Know

* To add a pin to your map, search for it or select it on the map, then choose**Add to map** .
* Create a driving route layer by choosing any destination and selecting the directions icon.

 In this article, you'll learn how to drop multiple pins on Google Maps so you can create a multi-destination itinerary.  

##  How to Drop Multiple Google Maps Pins 

 When you type a location in Google Maps and select**Directions** , you'll see just two pins: your starting location and your destination. To add more pins to the map, you'll need to create and customize your own map.  

1. [ Open Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/) and then[ follow these directions to create a custom map](https://www.lifewire.com/create-custom-route-on-google-maps-5199091) .

2. Type a location into the search bar above the map. As you type, you can choose the correct location from the dropdown list.

3. Once you select a location, it'll[ drop your first pin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-drop-a-pin-google-maps-4171835) onto your custom map. Select**Add to map** .  
![A dropped pin highlighted from a custom Google Maps map.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/W33Xwb3-ftGFb-O4dDmnqXh5YT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/005_drop-multiple-pins-on-google-maps-5197232-986a7f20a0bb4bb982f067d5d0f4f6f2.jpg)  
 Select a pin for formatting options that let you change the icon and color. You can even select the camera icon to add a custom photo or video for that location.
4. Another method to drop a pin on your map is to select the location icon under the search field. This will change your cursor to crosshairs. Select any location on the map and a new pin will appear there.

5. Give this location a title and then select**Save** to store your new pin on the map.

6. A third method to drop new pins is to select an existing location on the map. This will open a window with the location details. Select**Add to map** to pin this as another location in your itinerary.

 Your custom map with all your pinned locations is useful when traveling because you can access it anywhere, including in the Google Maps mobile app.

##  Converting Your Map Into a Driving Route

1. Get started creating your driving route by selecting the first of your destinations. Once it's selected, select the**directions** icon under the search field.

2. You'll see a new layer appear in the left pane with**Driving** identified under the layer name. The location you selected will appear first in your driving route.

3. In the route location field, type the name of the next destination. You'll see the location listed under the name of your locations layer. Choose the location and it'll appear as the next stop in your driving route.

4. Once you're finished adding all stops, you'll see your route outlined on the map with a blue line.
