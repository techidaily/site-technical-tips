## Elite Range Extenders of 2024 - Enhancing Your Wireless Experience

If you’re having a problem getting Wi-Fi in every room of your house, our experts say you should[buy the Netgear Nighthawk X4 EX7300](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D6JEMWS/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4043312%7Cnc8fdee3bd1f74e80adc2ff7a1880529019%7C) . It has the coverage, speed, and compatibility most people need, with a straightforward app-based setup process.

 Range extenders work by connecting wirelessly to the router you already have in an area where your Wi-Fi signal is strong and rebroadcasting that signal to parts of your house where the signal is weak or nonexistent.

 Pros

* Great wireless performance
* Simple to use

 Cons

* Blocks power outlet
* App setup is a bit clunky

 If you're happy with your router's overall performance and want better Wi-Fi coverage, the Netgear Nighthawk X4 will get the job done. This is our favorite Wi-Fi extender because it provides excellent performance and coverage for a decent price and isn't too difficult to set up.

 This extender has a range of up to 2,000 square feet, which makes it great for extending a network to a different floor or the distant corners of a large home. It's also able to handle a lot of devices at once. The AC2200 part of the name means it can deliver 2.2Gbps of bandwidth at once ([we've got an explanation of what that means here](https://www.lifewire.com/how-is-network-performance-measured-817422) ), which is enough to[stream Netflix in 4K](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-netflix-in-4k-1847830) , video chat on FaceTime, and maintain a competitive edge in online games, on several devices all at once. Realistically, your internet connection won't be this fast, but if you pay extra for a super fast connection, it's worth considering that this unit will support it.

 It's designed to plug directly into a wall socket and supports a WPS push-button setup, making it really easy to set up and use. It doesn't have an outlet pass-through, so it takes up one outlet but leaves the other free.

 If you have any devices that don't have Wi-Fi, this extender also has you covered there. The Nighthawk X4 includes an[Ethernet port](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546) that allows you to use a network cable to connect a smart TV, game console, or anything else requiring a wired connection.

 Pros

* Enhanced Wi-Fi coverage and signal strength
* Wi-Fi Analytics app for all status updates

 Cons

* Difficulty connecting to 5GHz band

 The Netgear EX3700 is worth a look if you're on a budget. It doesn't have the range or speed offered by many of the other extenders on this list, but it's a great option if you need a little extra range to connect a handful of wireless devices.

 The ideal scenario for this extender is expanding a spotty wireless network into a guest room or home office where you expect to connect only a few devices at a time. It can provide a maximum of 1,000 square feet of coverage and handle about enough bandwidth to stream in 4K, video chat, and download big files on a couple of devices at once without a lot of slowdowns.

 If you have smart home devices that have trouble connecting to your network, this extender can help with that as well. Smart home devices require a connection to your network, but they don't use up a lot of bandwidth.

 This extender has a small size to go along with its low price, and it's designed to be plugged directly into a power socket. It leaves the top outlet free for your other electronics, but it does use up the bottom one as it doesn't have a pass-through. It does include a single Ethernet port, which makes it an excellent option for your home office if you have a computer that doesn't support Wi-Fi.

 Pros

* Advanced Wi-Fi 6 Technology
* Intelligent Signal Indicator
* Can be used as a wired Access Point

 Cons

* Optimal performance requires Wi-Fi 6 devices

 If you have a blazing-fast internet connection and want to buy all the latest gadgets and devices, then the TP-Link RE505X offers one key feature you need:[Wi-Fi 6](https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345) .

 Wi-Fi 6 is faster and more efficient than Wi-Fi 5, which allows more devices to connect at once without experiencing a slowdown. Devices also use less power when connected to Wi-Fi 6, translating to longer battery life. The catch is that your router and your devices also need to support Wi-Fi 6, or you won’t see any benefit.

 If you have one of these Wi-Fi 6 devices, get the TP-Link RE505X to take advantage of its faster speeds.

 Pros

* Can add Wi-Fi 6 to your existing network
* Solid range
* Four Gigabit Ethernet ports to plug in TVs, consoles and other devices

 Cons

* Expensive

 The Netgear Nighthawk EAX80 is fast but expensive. This would likely be our top recommendation if it weren't for the price, which is on the high side. But this is it if you're looking for the best range extender to slot into a high-speed, high-traffic Wi-Fi network.

 This extender blankets an area of up to 2,500 square feet with a high-speed Wi-Fi 6 network. Its capabilities rival many high-end, standalone routers, which means you can expect the same speeds and strong connections from devices connected to this as devices connected to your primary Wi-Fi network.

 The AX part of the name refers to Wi-Fi 6, also known as 802.11ax, while the 6000 means this extender can handle up to 6Gbps of data at once. It also supports[beamforming](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-beamforming-4171262) , which allows compatible devices to form a stronger connection. It has four Ethernet ports for connecting devices via a cable—something you'll ideally want to do for the best speeds for devices like a streaming TV or console.

 It's swift, but remember, you may not need or be able to use that extra speed. Your connection speeds will depend on your internet connection and main router, but this extender can handle almost anything you can throw at it.

 Pros

* Four antennas offer great range
* Fast throughput
* Gigabit Ethernet port

 Cons

* A bit bulky

 If you have a big house with several rooms or even whole floors that are out of range of your main router, you probably want to prioritize range over everything else. The TP-Link RE650 is a range extender that emphasizes range, with a maximum coverage area of up to 2,800 square feet. It also has plenty of bandwidth and supports beamforming for robust connections.

 This is an excellent extender to choose if you need to extend Wi-Fi to a busy part of your house or if you have a large house with several rooms needing simultaneous coverage because it can handle a lot of data simultaneously. That makes it a good fit for covering a family room or busy home office with many devices connected at once. It also has a single Ethernet port, which is great for connecting a computer or game console.

 While the TP-Link RE650 is powerful and lets you extend your Wi-Fi over a large area, it’s also straightforward to use and set up. It uses an app-based setup procedure that walks you through the process with on-screen prompts and even includes a signal indicator to take all the guesswork out of choosing where to install the extender. That means you don’t need to worry about trying to get the best connection, even if you don’t have much network experience.

 Pros

* Powerline technology offers extended range
* Includes Gigabit Ethernet port

 Cons

* Performance is dependent on quality of home electrical wiring

 Most range extenders work by capturing the Wi-Fi signal from your main router and rebroadcasting it, but that isn’t always possible. If you’re trying to extend Wi-Fi to part of your home where brick walls or appliances block the signal, then a powerline extender like the Netgear PowerLINE 1000 can solve your problem.

 The Netgear PowerLINE 1000 sends a network connection through the electrical wiring in your house to an adapter, which creates its own Wi-Fi network at the other end. Devices that connect to the network are then connected to your main router through the electrical wiring in your house. It supports up to 1Gbps of bandwidth, which makes it a good solution for spreading a Wi-Fi signal to a small home office or guest bedroom where a connection would otherwise be impossible.

 In addition to creating a remote Wi-Fi network that connects back to your router through the electrical wiring, the PowerLINE 1000 also includes an Ethernet port for connecting a smart TV, game console, or computer that doesn’t support Wi-Fi. You can add up to 16 adapters to the system to bring wired and wireless connectivity to different parts of your home.

 Pros

* Dual-Band Wi-Fi
* Solid Performance
* Versatile with five wireless modes

 Cons

* Not ideal for a large number of Wi-Fi devices

 The TP-Link TL-WR902AC is a travel router that’s small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. Its primary purpose is to provide a strong Wi-Fi signal on the road, but it can pull double duty at home as a portable Wi-Fi extender.

 This router tips the scales at about 8 ounces. It’s also powered through a micro-USB port, so you don’t need to pack a special power adapter. It will run off just about any USB power supply, like your phone charger or a portable power pack.

 This extender’s range and bandwidth are on the low end, meaning it doesn’t extend Wi-Fi very far, and you can’t connect too many devices simultaneously. It has plenty of bandwidth to stream in 4K if you have a fast-enough internet connection, and portability is the more significant concern if you’re trying to stream Netflix in a hotel. Then, when you get home, you can also use it to boost the Wi-Fi signal in your house.

## What to Look For

 Also known as Wi-Fi boosters, Wi-Fi range extenders extend your home or office network's reach, allowing you to enjoy fast internet speeds no matter what corner you're sitting in. They eliminate dead zones, especially for devices far from your router, and ensure uninterrupted phone calls, browsing sessions, and anything you go online for.

 We use three criteria to evaluate any Wi-Fi range extender purchase: range/coverage, design, and security features.

**Range/Coverage**

 Arguably, the number one criterion for evaluating Wi-Fi range extenders is range. Prioritize Wi-Fi range extenders supporting Wi-Fi 6, which offers the latest data transfer standards by tapping into technologies like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) for improved performance over longer distances. We also prefer Wi-Fi extenders with a single high-gain antenna or multiple antennas supported by beamforming, which better "amplifies" Wi-Fi toward the direction of your supported devices.

 Kudos to any device with Ethernet ports for wired connectivity, allowing a more stable connection across all your devices.

**Design**

 On top of a compact and sleek design, look for Wi-Fi range extenders with flexible placement options. Ideally, they carry an integrated power outlet or allow for second or third placement options on your wall or desktop. Additionally, check for strategically placed indicator lights that inform you about power, signal strength, and other essential performance indicators. To prevent overheating, look for ventilation channels or heat sinks. For better signal coverage, opt for adjustable external antennas over internal antennas for improved Wi-Fi signal fine-tuning.

**Security Features**

 At a minimum, look for a Wi-Fi range extender that supports Wi-Fi 6, incorporating the latest encryption standards for improved protection against unauthorized access. As more and more devices become Wi-Fi 6 compatible over time, you'll also enjoy compatibility with future devices. Remember WPA2 encryption and automatic firmware updates for even greater leverage against potential security threats.

[The Best Long-Range Routers of 2024](https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554)

 FAQ

* How do you know if you need a Wi-Fi extender?  
 Do you have any “dead zones” in your house where the Wi-Fi doesn’t work or rooms where the signal is so weak your phone won’t stay connected? If you do, then a Wi-Fi extender can help bring the Wi-Fi from an area where it’s fairly strong to those areas where it doesn't work very well. The best Wi-Fi extenders can even speed up your Wi-Fi connection in areas of your house where it’s weak and slow. Just keep in mind that Wi-Fi extenders are designed only to fill in one specific area. Think of it like your router creating a bubble of Wi-Fi, and then the extender creating a second bubble near the edge of the original one. If you’re having coverage problems in multiple areas in different parts of your home, you’ll need multiple extenders or a long-range router.
* What causes Wi-Fi dead zones?  
 Think of your Wi-Fi signal like a radio playing- it gets quieter as it travels and goes through walls, doors, and floors. If you play music in one room, and then travel to the opposite side of your home or go downstairs to the basement, you may only be able to hear the music faintly (or not at all). When you turn the radio on, you can hear the sound with less interference on certain channels, and it may even play a bit louder on a specific channel. If you think of your Wi-Fi signal in the same way, you'll realize it’s also going to weaken as it travels over longer distances, especially as it goes through doors, walls, floors, appliances, and other obstacles.
* What is the difference between a Wi-Fi extender, a mesh Wi-Fi system and a Wi-Fi repeater?  
 In most cases, Wi-Fi extenders, Wi-Fi repeaters, and Wi-Fi boosters are all simply different names for the same type of device. All serve the same goal of increasing the range of your wireless network, although it’s important to keep in mind that not all Wi-Fi extenders work quite the same way or offer the same features. For example, while most Wi-Fi extenders connect to your main router over Wi-Fi, some connect through your home’s electrical wiring. So be sure to read the fine print and check the system requirements when picking a Wi-Fi extender for your particular needs. A[mesh Wi-Fi system](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178) is also known as a whole-home Wi-Fi System. It uses a central router that connects to the modem and one or more satellite routers (or nodes) that all act as access points for the Wi-Fi signal. This way, you can place the different nodes around your home and extend your coverage far beyond the range you’d get if you only had a single router.
* Do Wi-Fi extenders work with any router?  
 Unlike mesh Wi-Fi systems, Wi-Fi extenders are designed to work with almost any router, in much the same way as any other wireless device. If you’re concerned about performance, make sure the extender supports the same version of Wi-Fi as your router. For example, if your router supports Wi-Fi 6, getting an extender that supports Wi-Fi 6 will provide the best experience.
* How big an area will an extender cover?  
 In the product’s description, you’ll often find a square footage amount that indicates the extender’s coverage range. If you opt for an extender, you can expect to extend coverage by about 1,200 square feet. If you purchase an extender with 1,200 square feet of coverage, that coverage is in addition to your router, so if your router provides 2,000 square feet of coverage, you can expect about 3,200 square feet of total coverage—assuming you place the Wi-Fi extender at the very edge of your existing router's range. In most cases, you'll likely end up with some overlap.
