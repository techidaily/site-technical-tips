Hundreds of Samsung apps for Samsung Smart TVs are available, but which are the best must-have apps?

 You get the obvious streaming video apps with Netflix, Vudu, Amazon, and Hulu included on Smart TVs, but there are many other TV apps out there.

 Here's a list that will help you decide which ones you want to try.
