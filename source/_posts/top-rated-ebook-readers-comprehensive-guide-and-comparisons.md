What's the best epub reader? If you are interested in reading epub files (and who isn't at this point), you can't escape hearing about epub reader app. But as there are a wide variety of reading devices, the epub reader apps we can choose for our eReaders are also different. Then our question as I stated at the beginning of this article arises. I have always insisted that "there is nothing best but better", so I say maybe I couldn't give you a satisfactory answer immediately. In this content all I can do is to introduce my own **best epub reader review** (in fact a lot of people love these what I've gathered). And if the files what you got are in PDF format, please read this article [top 7 PDF reader and editor for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### EPUB Reader from Official eBook Store

There are some reading apps released from official ebook stores support epub format. They are:

[Kobo](http://www.kobo.com/apps?%5F%5F%5Fstore=us&style=onestore)\--Kobo desktop app, Kobo for iPhone/iPad, Kobo for Android, Kobo for Blackberry 10, Kobo for Win8 and Win8 Phone.![best epub reader](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Best-ePub-Reader.jpg)

These official apps are only supported for dedicated stores. Nearly all the stores (I listed above) put their DRM limitation on their books. For example, if your epub books are purchased from Play Books, then you can only open and read them in Play Books, not available in kobo, or Nook. No way to read google epub books in Kobo unless [drm removing](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### EPUB Reader for Win7 or Win8

I have expressed the compatible devices based on each reader I listed above. But for a convenient reading, I will collect them together for you again: Kobo, Adobe Digital Editions, FBReader.

They are all free epub reader at the moment. When downloading option just choose your computer system.

And for Win 8, Nook app is available. Have a try if you like.

And here I also like to say my own opinions. When reading short essays or comics, reading with computer large screen is a good adventure, but if you are reading a long novel, you'd better not read epub with computer.

### Which one is the best?

I have gathered best epub reader so that you can enjoy your epub files no matter where you are and what your device is.

When asked me which one is the best, my answer is still "no best only better". And, here my better solution for you is epub drm removing.

Don't you think drm checking is so messy? After we purchased one book, we couldn't find out whether it has drm or not, yes? So how can we decide which reader is available?

If you are an ebook super fan, like me, we will buy different kinds of books from different stores, yes? So need we install several separate reading apps on one device? Then when reading we should check where those books from, and exit to another reader? Oh God.

Do you want to read epub books within one epub reader without drm worries? Do you wish to sync downloaded books on reading devices? Do you want to share purchased ePubs with friends and family?

You can have all of them by keeping one simple piece of advice in mind: **[Removing drm from epub books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)**. Tool I have found, free download.

[Windows Version Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [Mac Version Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

Here I want to share my another tip. In most cases after we click on downloading an epub book, we will receive an .acsm file. At this time we are sure that the acsm file has drm. We need to decrypt.

All come to the end. Hope this article could give you a hand, with these best epub reader.

I've been very happy with infinity Reader from Google Play play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imeonsoft.infinity 

 The reader supports audio, video,  
 scripts and all EPUB3 features. The reader comes with a free book, which  
 contains youtube video. I can download a lot of free books directly from the reader.
