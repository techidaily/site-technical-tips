## Transportation Showdown: Can You Save Money with Uber Compared to a Traditional Taxi Service?
 Rideshare services like Uber and Lyft have infiltrated nearly every major city in recent years, effectively giving taxis a run for their money. While summoning an Uber with a simple tap on your smartphone may seem convenient, deciding between Uber and a taxi can be challenging when considering cost-effectiveness.

## Which Is Cheaper: Uber or Taxis?

 Taxi fares vary drastically by location, and the same is true for Uber fees. Uber also offers different levels of service based on your preferences. Here's how local rates compare to the standard UberX:

* In Washington D.C.,[taxis charge $3.50 for the first 1/8 mile](https://dfhv.dc.gov/page/taxicab-fares#) , $2.16 for each additional mile, and about $2 for every five minutes of wait time. UberX charges a booking fee of $2, a[base fare of $1.21](http://taxihowmuch.com/location/washington-dc-us) , 30 cents per minute, and 80 cents per mile.
* In New York City, a[taxi charges an initial fee of $3.00](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page) , 70 cents per 1/5 mile, and various surcharges. UberX charges a[base fare of $2.55](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/021015/uber-versus-yellow-cabs-new-york-city.asp) , a per-minute charge of 35 cents, and a per-mile charge of $1.75.
* In Los Angeles, a taxi costs[$3.10 for the first 1/9 of a mile](http://www.lacitycab.com/rates/) , 33 cents for each additional 1/9 mile, and 33 cents for every 37 seconds of wait time. UberX, however, charges[no base fare, 28 cents per minute, and 80 cents per mile](http://taxihowmuch.com/location/los-angeles-ca-us) . (There's a booking fee of $2.30.)
* In Philadelphia,[taxis charge $2.70 for the first 1/10 mile](http://www.philly-taxi.com/fares.htm) , 25 cents for each additional fraction of a mile, and 25 cents for every 37.6 seconds of waiting. UberX charges a $2 booking fee, a[base fare of $1.38](http://taxihowmuch.com/location/philadelphia-pa-us) , a per-minute fee of 32 cents, and a per-mile fee of 92 cents.

 The cost of your trip will depend on many factors, including distance traveled, traffic conditions, and the time of day. While some of the rates are similar in structure and amount, there is one major difference: taxis charge per mile when moving, yet they charge per minute while idling. Uber, on the other hand, charges per mile and minute, regardless of whether the car is moving or idling, with a few exceptions.

 If you're considering which service to take to the airport, the cheaper option is almost always Uber.

## Cost Variables to Consider

 When comparing the cost of Uber and taxis, there are additional variables to consider. For example, many taxi riders tip their drivers around 20 percent.[Uber](https://www.lifewire.com/how-does-uber-work-3862752) offers a tipping option as well.

 Uber's surge pricing is another major variable that can affect cost. Surge pricing essentially means that Uber's cost varies depending on demand, so expect to pay a higher fare on nights where cabs are in high demand, such as New Year's Eve. In addition to a minimum fare amount, Uber also charges a cancellation fee that varies by city.

 If you open the Uber app and see a 1.8 surge price, then a $10 trip will cost you closer to $18\. â€‹Avoid surge pricing by waiting a few minutes or walking a few blocks (if you're in a safe area) in another direction. One customer infamously paid[$14,000 for a 20-minute Uber ride](https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/uber-surge-pricing-snafu-results-in-shocking-14400-charge-for-a-20-minute-ride-dont-be-next-victim.html) due to surge pricing, so pay attention to how much you're being charged.

## Uber vs. Taxis: The Verdict

 Uber is typically cheaper for longer trips moving at a faster speed, while taxis are a better choice for trips in congested areas like New York City. That said, geographic location also matters. Historically, Uber has been cheaper than a taxi in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Detroit, while taxis are cheaper in New York City. It's a near-draw in cities like Washington, D.C., and Nashville. A study by GOBankingRates found that Uber was the more economical choice in 16 of 20 major U.S. cities.
