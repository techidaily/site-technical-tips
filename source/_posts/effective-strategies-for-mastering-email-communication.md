[No longer supporting this?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/4/2016 5:53:38 AM 

I bought a lifetime license. I have had several reformats of my system and need a new unlock code. And this probably won't be the last time  
 I am getting ZERO response from tech support. Chats aren't answered, Tickets don't have numbers, emails are never answered.  
 I payed ahead in good faith and would like that good faith to be respected  
 Thanks  
 Rick

[Registration Fails with License Email](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/27/2020 4:53:15 AM 

Epubor Audible Convertor v1.0.10.230  
 Windows 10

 When attempting to register the program with the License email, I get the following error: "Registration failed, please try to enter "email;License code" to register.

 However when trying to get the license code from the website, I am sent an email to download the program. I never get the license code.

[Am I free??](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/28/2019 1:09:25 PM 

I want to make sure I’m not paying for epubor ultimate. Back in December I signed up for the free trial version (30 days). I do not remember giving my credit card information (though my memory may be playing tricks on me). I expected the program to stop working after 30 days, but it didn’t. Since this happened 8 months ago, I don’t remember the steps I took to install the program. How can I know if Epubor is charging me for using this program? Everything works just fine, which is highly suspicious. Every time I open it, a window asking for my registration code pops up, but I just close it and use the program. Does this window pops up for those of you who have payed for Epubor? Also, the program (in the configurations part) says that I’m licensed to a free trial. I guess it should have my email there if I had paid for this.  
 Maybe I’m being paranoid. Help??

[Email for Epubor renewal](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/26/2021 5:54:12 AM 

I have received an email from epubor@gmail.com asking for renewal of my Epubor Ultimate.  
 The link provided gets me to the following URL:  
 https://secure.avangate.com/order/checkout.php?LICENSE=B1797A8BF8&QTY=1&PRODS=4600274&LANG=en&PAY\_TYPE=CCVISAMC&CURRENCY=EUR&RENEWAL\_SRC=email\_-7&COUPON=10-DIS&CART\_ID=e99566e84c318d48b06e915010eb6970

 Is this a REAL epubor email, or a spam?  
 Thank you

[7-day Free License](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/14/2022 4:00:39 AM 

Hi,

 I would be very keen to try your VitalSource Downloader software, I have already subscribed to your YouTube channel and posted a comment as requested, which I understand entitles me to a free 7-day license.

 Please email: kgreig.fjuk@gmail.com

 Many thanks,
