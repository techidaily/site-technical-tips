### Fix 1 – Restart the Oculus VR Runtime service

 When Oculus fails to communicate with its core service, the ‘can’t reach oculus runtime service’ error will appear and you might not be able to use your controller normally. In this case, you need to restart the Oculus Runtime service. Here is how:

 Once it’s done, restart your Oculus app to see if the controller works. If not, move on to the next method below.

### Fix 2 – Turn off USB selective suspend

 USB selective suspend is a Windows feature that puts certain USB ports in the suspend state to save your computer from using unnecessary power. However, it might cause your Oculus VR rig to stop working randomly.

To disable USB power saving, follow the steps below:

1. Type**power plan** in the Windows search box and click**Edit power plan** .

### Fix 3 – Disable conflicting software

 The Oculus controller not working problem is likely to occur if you have multiple programs running in the background and they’re conflicting with your Oculus app. To see if that’s the cause, simply shut down all the unnecessary applications.

1. Right-click any empty space on the taskbar and select**Task Manager** .

1. Go to the[Oculus Setup page](https://www.oculus.com/setup/) and click**Download software** .
2. Click**Yes** when you’re prompted.
3. Open the downloaded file and click**Repair** .

 It may take a few minutes for the repair to complete. Then relaunch the Oculus app to see whether your controller goes back to normal. If not, there is one more fix to try.

### Fix 5 – Update your device drivers

 Drivers matter a lot to the performance of your devices. To keep your VR rig up and running and gain the most smooth experience with Oculus Rift, Rift S or Quest, you should install the latest device drivers on your computer all the time.

There are mainly two ways to update the drivers for your Oculus devices:

**Option 1 – Manually** : You can search for the most recent Oculus driver from its **[support page](https://support.oculus.com/)**  . Then, download the driver that is compatible with your Windows version, and install it step by step.

**Option 2 – Automatically** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your headset, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)
