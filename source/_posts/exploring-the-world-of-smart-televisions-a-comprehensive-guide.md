## Exploring the World of Smart Televisions: A Comprehensive Guide
 A TV with internet is a television designed to[connect to the internet](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-smart-tv-to-wifi-4587350) and display content from online sources. You can use an internet TV to watch YouTube videos, check the weather, stream Netflix shows, rent movies on Amazon Prime, or perform any other task available on the internet.

 In most ways, an internet-equipped TV (often called a[smart TV](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-4140172) ) delivers the same functionality as a hardware streaming device like a[Roku](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-roku-4142216) or[Apple TV](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-apple-tv-1994193) , as well as the usual television channels provided by an antenna or cable/satellite subscription.

 You'll need a[high-speed internet](https://www.lifewire.com/what-highspeed-internet-choices-are-available-2483358) connection and an unlimited or generous data allowance with your internet provider to take advantage of all the features of an internet-enabled TV.

 Smart TVs are made by a variety of manufacturers including LG, Samsung, Panasonic, Sony, and Vizio.

 These sets differ from televisions that double as[computer monitors](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-monitor-2618155) —although many can do that as well—because no computer or outside equipment is required to display web content. It is important to note, however, that viewable internet content varies by manufacturer. All major television manufacturers make smart TVs with beautiful displays, so picking out the correct set for you can be difficult.

## What You Need

 To[use the internet-enabled functions on a TV](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-enable-your-tv-3276356) , you must connect the television to the internet. In most cases, this can be done wirelessly (which requires a wireless router), but some televisions require a[wired Ethernet connection](https://www.lifewire.com/home-theater-connection-photo-gallery-4064167) . After the TV is connected to your wireless router or directly to your modem by cable, it uses your high-speed broadband internet connection to deliver internet content.

 There is no additional charge for the basic internet functionality on the TV, but some services, such as [Netflix](https://www.lifewire.com/overview-of-the-netflix-streaming-service-1847831) and[Amazon Video](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-video-4176363) , have subscription charges if you want to use the services. You may need to upgrade your internet data limit with your internet provider if you find yourself streaming a large amount of content.
