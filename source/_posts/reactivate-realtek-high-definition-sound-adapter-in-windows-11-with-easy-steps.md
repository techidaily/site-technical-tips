Windows Update is a feature that automatically checks and provide updates for our computer.

 But sometimes it can be such a big pain that you want to turn it off.

 Here are 3 easy-to-follow methods you can try to**stop Windows update in Windows 10** .

4. **[Bonus tip: Update your device drivers via Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Method 1: Disable the Windows Update Service

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**   and **R**   at the same time. Then copy & paste **services.msc**   into the box and click **OK** .

 It’s recommendable to select**Enabled** and**Notify for downloads and auto install** (see below) so that you can always get a confirmation message instead of an auto update (meanwhile still keeping a watchful eye for an important Windows update). Also, you might need to select**Enabled** if you are to upgrade your Windows to a higher version.
