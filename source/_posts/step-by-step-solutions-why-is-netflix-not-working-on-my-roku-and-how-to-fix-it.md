##  Why Does Netflix Keep Crashing on My Roku TV? 

 When you[ use Netflix on Roku](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-netflix-on-roku-7480169) , you're dealing with two different online services, so there are multiple points of failure.

 There could be an issue with the Netflix service, with the Roku connection to your TV, or something to do with your internet connection itself.

 The first important step is to first verify these services are working. Then move on to checking your Wi-Fi network, your internet connection, and then issues with the Roku streaming player itself.

 This issue applies to all Roku streaming players including Roku Express, Roku Streaming Stick, Roku Ultra, and Roku Streambar.

##  How to Fix When Netflix Won't Work on Roku 

 Work through these troubleshooting steps in order to diagnose and potentially fix the issue.  

1. [ Troubleshoot the Netflix service](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-netflix-not-working-4177972) . The[ Netflix Help Center page](https://help.netflix.com/is-netflix-down) will show the current status of the Netflix service. If Netflix is down, you'll need to wait until they sort out the problem.
2. Make sure your Roku streaming device is properly connected to your TV. To verify that your Roku streaming device is working properly, try launching another service like the Hulu app. If that doesn't work as well, perhaps the Roku needs attention. If the other app does launch, it could just be the Netflix app.
3. [ Perform a full restart on your Roku device](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-your-roku-4167636) . This means completely powering down the Roku streaming device (you may need to fully disconnect the power cable), and then starting it up again. Often, a simple restart can resolve most issues when Netflix won't work on Roku.  
 If you notice the power light on your Roku device flickering when you plug it in, you could have a faulty power port. Try a different power cable. If the light still flickers, you may need to replace your Roku streaming device.
4. [ Make sure the Roku device is connected to Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-roku-to-wifi-4174681) . Check other devices like a computer or smartphone and make sure your Wi-Fi network is working. If it isn't, you'll need to[ troubleshoot your home Wi-Fi network](https://www.lifewire.com/troubleshooting-no-wireless-connection-2378241) before Netflix will work properly on your Roku device. If you can't connect anything to your Wi-Fi network,[ restarting the router](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570) usually helps.  
 If you can successfully connect to any other channel on your Roku, then the device can access the internet fine. In this case, you can skip this step and move on to other troubleshooting steps below.
5. [ Update the Roku app on your mobile device](https://www.lifewire.com/update-apps-on-android-7106106) . Over time, apps can get out of date, especially if you have auto-updates turned off. If you're trying to launch Netflix with your mobile device, this may be why Netflix won't launch. Make sure to update the Roku Android app or the Roku iOS app, depending on which device you own. If Netflix still doesn't work, try completely deleting the Roku app from your Android or iOS and then reinstall it from scratch.
6. Make sure your Netflix account is still active. If you can log in to your Netflix account on other devices, double-check the[ Netflix profile](https://www.lifewire.com/add-netflix-profile-4172554) you're trying to use on Roku still exists. If all else fails, try[ changing your Netflix account password](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-netflix-password-4173381) , and then reconnect your Netflix app on Roku using that new password.
7. [ Turn off your VPN](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-vpn-on-android-7642980) . If you use a[ VPN](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-vpn-5189778) to connect your router or Roku device to the internet, your VPN may be causing connection issues. Turning off your VPN and connecting to the internet directly may resolve your Netflix channel issues.
8. [ Troubleshoot your Roku remote](https://www.lifewire.com/is-your-roku-remote-not-working-4175275) . You may need to[ reset the Roku remote](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-roku-remote-4176396) and then[ pair it with your Roku streaming device](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-pair-roku-remote-4175130) again. If you can't get your remote to work, try launching the Netflix channel with the[ Roku mobile app instead](https://www.lifewire.com/best-ways-to-use-roku-mobile-app-4176193) .
9. [ Check Roku parental controls](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-roku-parental-controls-4797152) . Make sure that the account you're trying to use isn't blocked from launching the Netflix content that you want to watch. While you're at it, check the[ Netflix parental control settings](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-netflix-parental-controls-4842855) for your Netflix account as well.
10. [ Reset your Roku streaming device](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-roku-4174678) . If all else has failed, you may need to reset your Roku to factory settings.  
 When you restart after the reset, you'll also notice that all of your channels are gone. You'll need to re-add them.
