## Fixing the Elusive Wmvcore.dll File Missing Issue Easily
 Wmvcore.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the Windows Media Playback/Authoring DLL (the wmvcore[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) ). In some cases, these errors could indicate a[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

[Free Programs That Can Replace Windows Media Player](https://www.lifewire.com/free-programs-that-can-replace-windows-media-player-2438481)

## How to Fix Wmvcore.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're listed below to try the more likely fixes first.

 Do not download wmvcore.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons[why downloading a DLL file that way is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore wmvcore.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" wmvcore.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete this step, or any of the other ones below, if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. Install Windows Media Player, which is the source of the wmvcore.dll file.  
 The best way to do this (at least for Windows 10 N editions) is to install[Media Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack) from Microsoft. See [How to Tell If You Have Windows 64-bit or 32-bit](https://www.lifewire.com/am-i-running-a-32-bit-or-64-bit-version-of-windows-2624475) if you're not sure which link to choose on that page.  
 If Windows isn't fully updated, you'll need to download the Media Feature Pack version that works on your specific Windows build. To do that, first check which version of Windows you're running with the**winver** command through the Run dialog box (**WIN** +**R** ), and then download the correct file from Microsoft that pertains to your version of Windows.  
 For example, if you're running version 1803, you'd want to choose that option on the download page.  
 Some editions of Windows don't include Windows Media Player by default, even though some third-party programs require some of its components, like the wmvcore.dll file. Installing Windows Media Player or the Media Feature Pack will add the DLL file to the computer and give other programs access to it, which will likely solve the problem.  
 If you're using a Windows Server OS, the_Turn windows features on or off_ [Control Panel applet](https://www.lifewire.com/control-panel-applet-2625831) is where you can go to install the necessary Windows Media Player libraries. In there, choose**Features** \>**Add Features** and then select**Desktop Experience** . Confirm any prompts and follow through with the setup wizard to complete the WMP install.
3. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some wmvcore.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
4. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
5. [Update the drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) for hardware devices that might be related to wmvcore.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file wmvcore.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your video card.  
 The wmvcore.dll file may or may not be related to video cardsâ€”this was just an example. The key here is to pay close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
6. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if wmvcore.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
7. [Run the sfc /scannow System File Checker command](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161) to replace a missing or corrupt copy of the wmvcore.dll file. Since this file is provided by Microsoft in some versions of Windows, the SFC tool should restore it in those Windows editions.
8. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many service packs and other patches replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The wmvcore.dll file could be included in one of those updates.
9. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's memory and hard drive are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause wmvcore.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
10. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual wmvcore.dll file troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
11. Use a[registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair wmvcore.dll related issues in the registry. A program from that list might be able to help by removing invalid wmvcore.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. They're included as an option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
12. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the hard drive and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the wmvcore.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
13. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any wmvcore.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.

 There are several ways wmvcore.dll errors can show up on your computer, such as:

* **Wmvcore.dll Not Found**
* **This application failed to start because wmvcore.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.**
* **Cannot find \[PATH\]\\wmvcore.dll**
* **The file wmvcore.dll is missing.**
* **Cannot start \[APPLICATION\]. A required component is missing: wmvcore.dll. Please install \[APPLICATION\] again.**

 These error messages might appear while using or installing certain programs or video games, or when Windows first starts or shuts down.

 The context of the error is an important piece of information that will be helpful while solving the problem. The error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's operating systems, including Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, etc.
