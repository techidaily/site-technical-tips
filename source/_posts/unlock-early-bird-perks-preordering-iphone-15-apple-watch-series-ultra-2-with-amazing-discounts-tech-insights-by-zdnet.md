## Unlock Early Bird Perks: Preordering iPhone 15, Apple Watch Series Ultra 2 with Amazing Discounts | Tech Insights

![Apple iPhone 15](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/31dab4fb7eca3b39f241b30aaf514fb4a7030f03/2023/09/13/6ecb3064-f72e-48bb-924e-fbb230fa5401/iphone-15-meta-phone-photo.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Apple's highly anticipated fall event happened earlier this week, which means there are plenty of new devices to shop. During the nearly two-hour event, Apple announced the latest iPhone 15 lineup, the Apple Watch Series 9, the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and technically new (but not really) AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case. 

It's important to note that all of the devices announced this week feature USB-C charging, something that Apple was forced to do by the European Union's decree that -- by the end of 2024 -- [all smartphones and tablets must use the same USB-C connector.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-will-get-usb-c-charging-as-apple-says-it-will-comply-with-eu-law/)

**Also:** [**Everything Apple just announced: iPhone 15, Apple Watch Ultra 2, AirPods**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-announced-today-iphone-15-apple-watch-ultra-2-airpods/)

Preorders for all the devices have already begun, with the iPhone 15 series, Apple Watches, and AirPods preorders on Friday, September 15, and open sales starting on Friday, September 22.

Here's where you can preorder the latest Apple products, as well as where to find the best deals to save on your investments.

## iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus

June Wan/ZDNET

Apple's entry-level iPhone models received new upgrades like a Dynamic Island display, new cameras, and, of course, [USB-C charging](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-iphone-15s-usb-c-upgrade-may-have-serious-implications-for-the-charging-accessory-future/). You can expect the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus to be available in five new colors: yellow, pink, green, black, and white.

June Wan/ZDNET

Meanwhile, Apple's more premium iPhone models have a new Titanium design that's lighter and more durable, as well as a more powerful[A17 Pro chip](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a17-pro-deep-dive-a-look-at-apples-new-iphone-15-pro-chip/). The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also replace the mute-switch toggle with a customizable Action Button and the Lightning charger with USB-C charging (that promises to charge faster, too).
