## What's Next? Dealing With a Temporarily Disabled Instagram Account

Close 

 Instagram can disable or deactivate your account without notifying you, so it’s not always clear why your account has been disabled or how to get it back. This article will give possible reasons for your ban and how to get your account back.

##  Why Was My IG Account Disabled? 

 Even if your account is reinstated, you may never find out exactly why it was deactivated. Reasons may include:

* You have multiple intellectual property violations.
* You repeatedly shared fraudulent or misleading content.
* You bought likes or fake followers.
* You used violent or offensive language.
* You used a third-party tool to automatically follow users or leave likes and comments.
* You were automatically banned by accident.

 This guide does not apply to users who[ intentionally deleted their accounts](https://www.lifewire.com/delete-instagram-accounts-3485865) .

##  How Can I Get My Instagram Account Back? 

 If you just found out that your Instagram account has been deactivated, try these steps to get it back.

1. [ Check for log-in issues](https://help.instagram.com/374546259294234) . Instagram will display a message stating that your account has been disabled. If you don't see a message like that, rule out other log-in problems.
2. [ Delete third-party apps](https://www.lifewire.com/delete-apps-on-android-phone-5271421) .Third-party apps like Follow Guard or Followers Insight are[ against Instagram’s Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/263751177667145/?helpref=search&query=deactivated&search%5Fsession%5Fid=1479f017c035a5ef58fe9c9fe8fab374&sr=8) . Even if your account is reinstated, you can get banned again for using these third-party services. Save yourself the headache and get rid of them now.  
 Third-party apps require your Instagram account information to work properly. Sharing this information leaves your account vulnerable to hackers.
3. [ Appeal your ban from the app's Support Inbox](https://help.instagram.com/280908123309761) . Open the app and tap your profile and go to**More info and support** \>**Help** \>**Support Requests** \>**Violations** .
4. [ Request a review from your Account Status](https://help.instagram.com/338481628002750) . You can also appeal Instagram from your Account Status page. Open your profile from the mobile app > tap**More info and support** \>**Help** \>**Account Status** .  
 Even if you were breaking Instagram's rules, don't assume that is the reason for your ban. Admitting to rule-breaking behavior won't help your case.
5. [ Appeal your ban for sharing misleading information.](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/693680257839261?helpref=faq%5Fcontent) If your account was disabled for violating others' intellectual property rights or sharing fraudulent or misleading information, this is the proper form to use.
6. [ Appeal your business account's ban.](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/422289316306981) Some users report success through[ Facebook Business support](https://www.facebook.com/business/help) , an option available to people who run ads on Facebook.
7. [ Submit proof of your identity.](https://help.instagram.com/293775921768331/?helpref=related%5Farticles) Instagram will ask for proof of your identity to reverse your ban. Provide them with a picture of a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver’s license. The ID must show your name and date of birth. Cover up other identifying information, like your address or social security number.  
 If you don’t have a government-issued photo ID, send another form of identification, like government-issued permits (like fishing or hunting licenses), medical records, bank statements, or utility bills. For a full list,[ check here](https://help.instagram.com/271237319690904/?helpref=faq%5Fcontent) .
8. [ See if you're eligible to appeal to the Oversight Board](https://help.instagram.com/675885993348720/) . If your appeal was reviewed twice and you disagree with the result, you may be able to try a third appeal to the Oversight Board. Check from**More info and support** \>**Help** \>**Violations** \> and look for an**Oversight Board Reference Number >** and enter it at the[ Oversight Board website](https://www.oversightboard.com/) .  
 If you don't see an Oversight Board Reference Number, your appeal doesn't quality for this extra review.
9. [ Make a new account.](https://help.instagram.com/155940534568753) It may take weeks or even months to successfully appeal the deactivation of your account. If you don't want to wait that long or if you decide it's not that important, create a new one instead.

* How many reports does it take to ban an Instagram account?  
 If someone is violating the Terms of Service, Instagram can suspend an account after a single report. Multiple reports may result in longer suspensions or full deactivation.
