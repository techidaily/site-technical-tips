I have a bunch of PDF eBooks with copy protection on my pc. It’s inconvenient for me to print or edit. I ever met a PDF document which could be opened or copied, but there were a couple of pages that I could't open. I could see them on the bookmark toolbar and click them, but it won't show up the pages. So I will share how to **remove PDF password security restrictions** on printing, editing, and copying a PDF file with readers.

### Difference between user password and owner password

The user password is known as a document open password. Users must type in the password you specify to open the PDF for viewing, editing, printing, etc.

The owner password is known as a master password or permissions password. Recipients don’t need a password to open the document. But they must type the permissions password to set or change the restricted features. For an instance, when you convert password protected PDF files to EPUB format, the Calibre will alert a window to forbid you to change files type as follow.

There are two cases worthy of us to introduce how to fulfill break PDF password step by step.

**Case 1:** PDF files have both user password and owner password

**Case 2:** PDF files have an owner password only

If PDF files have both user password and owner password, users should input the right user password. Then all locks and restrictions will be removed.

1Run PDF password Remover

3Crack PDF password 

Click “Start” button and it will pop up a window to prompt you to enter a user password in order to remove all password restriction. Make sure you enter the correct user password for pushing “OK” button.

Then click “Start” button again and it decrypts the PDF files successfully. Select “Open” next to the “Start” button in the bottom. It will navigate you to find the PDF files.

This method really works. I use Pasprog Forgotten PDF Password to recover PDF passwords in combination with this program. Sometimes you have to use several programs to recover complex passwords. <https://pasprog.com/forgotten-pdf-password.php>
