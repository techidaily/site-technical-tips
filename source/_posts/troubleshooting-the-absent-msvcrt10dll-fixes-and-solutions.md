 Cygwin1.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the cygwin1[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) . In some cases, cygwin1.dll errors could indicate a[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

## How to Fix Cygwin1.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're presented to try the more helpful solutions first.

 Do not download cygwin1.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons[why downloading a DLL file in that way is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source (see step 1).

1. [Install Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) , the source of the cygwin1.dll file.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Installing or reinstalling Cygwin, the program that provides the cygwin1.dll file, is a very likely solution to this DLL error.
2. [Restore cygwin1.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . Other than installing Cygwin, this is the easiest possible fix for a "missing" cygwin1.dll file, since you might have just mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover cygwin1.dll with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
 Undeleting this file is smart only if you're confident you've deleted the file yourself and that it was working properly before you did that.
3. Add the path of the cygwin1.dll file as a_system_ [environment variable](https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-environment-variables-2625868) .  
 It's possible that a program that needs this file is looking for it through an environment variable that's missing or incorrect. You can fix this by adding the path of the DLL file (e.g., "C:\\cygwin64\\") as an environment variable.  
[See this Stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6752578/the-program-cant-start-because-cygwin1-dll-is-missing-in-eclipse-cdt) if you need help doing this.  
 This solution is only useful if you're not actually missing the file.
4. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some cygwin1.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the cygwin1.dll error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
5. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the cygwin1.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
6. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to cygwin1.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file cygwin1.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 This file may or may not be related to video cardsâ€”this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
7. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if cygwin1.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
8. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual cygwin1.dll file troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation might help.
9. Use a[free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair cygwin1.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid cygwin1.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. We've included the option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
10. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the cygwin1.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during a clean install. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the cygwin1.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
11. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any cygwin1.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.
