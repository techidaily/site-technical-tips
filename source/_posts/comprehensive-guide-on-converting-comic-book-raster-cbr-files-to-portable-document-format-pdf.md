CBR is the most popular comic format on the Internet. But it's unsupported on e-book readers or tablets. It's a pity that you have many CBR comic books at hand but you can't read them on your Kindle or iPad. So I come up with the idea of converting CBR files into PDF format which most e-book readers support. Here we list two methods of converting CBR to PDF.

### Method 1\. Convert CBR to PDF with Calibre

Calibre is a very powerful and free e-book management program. It supports multiple e-book formats conversion.

#### **Step1\. Download and install Calibre**

Click here to download [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download). Choose the right platform to suit your PC.

#### **Step2\. Add CBR comics**

Launch Calibre and click "Add books" to add comics. You can also drag comic files to Calibre. Select the comic you want to convert and it will be added to the list.

Generally you just need to follow the two steps above. It must point out that you must select the "Disable comic processing" option otherwise the colorful comic will turn into black-and-white one. 

### Method 2\. Convert CBR to PDF with Microsoft Word

Many people think it's boring and inconvenient to download and install software. They want a simple way like using something very common. So here comes the second method – converting with Microsoft Word, a program which almost everyone has in their PC. OK, let's follow the steps below

#### **Step1\. Change your CBR files into images**

You may be confused of this step. Actually CBR means "Comic Book RAR". A CBR files is a RAR file. Rename the CBR filename suffix "cbr" into "rar" and extract the new rar file. You'll get a new folder of many pictures.

#### **Step2\. Import image**

Create a new Microsoft Word file. Click "Insert" to import images you just extracted before. Press "Ctrl" and "A" together to select all images.

#### **Step3\. Set page layout**

You need to set the page layout to suit the e-book reader's screen. This step is a bit complicated. But don't worry. Just do as the guide says below.

First, press "Ctrl" and "A" together to select all image in the docx. Set the align mode as "center".

Click "Page Layout" and the setup icon to call out the page layout menu.

Select "Margins" and set all margins as "0".

![convert cbr to pdf-set page margin](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/11-convert cbr to pdf-set page margin.jpg)

Set page margins

Select "Paper" and set width and height. For a better reading experience, I suggest you set the width and height similar to your –e-book reader's resolution. For example, if your e-book reader is Kindle Fire which has a resolution of 1024\*600\. Then you should set the width and height as **"6.00"**  and **"10.24"**.

Select "Layout". Set options like this:
