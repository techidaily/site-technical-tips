## Twitch Account Termination Process - A Comprehensive Walkthrough

Close 

###  What to Know

* Log in to your**Twitch** account and select**Settings** from the menu in the upper-right corner of the screen.
* Select**Disable Account** , enter your password, and then click**Disable Account** .

 This article explains how to disable your Twitch account. It includes information on why you should or shouldn't disable your account, as well as the steps to take before you disable the account.

##  How to Completely Disable Your Twitch Account 

 Twitch doesn't provide users with an option to completely delete their data, but it does allow for the disabling of accounts, which is the next best thing.

1. Log in to your Twitch account on the main Twitch website.
2. Click on the menu icon in the top-right corner and select **Settings.**  
![Settings menu on Twitch home page](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C8wNpyv2TQSU-GRkq2NAao1WRfw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_delete-twitch-account-4151061-5bfdddbfc9e77c002605b251.jpg)
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the settings page where you should see a section called, **Disable Your Twitch Account** . Click on **Disable Account** .

4. On the **Disable Account** page, enter your account password and any feedback you want to share with Twitch about your decision to leave. This second part is optional.
5. Click the purple **Disable Account** button. Your account is now disabled.

 Disabling a Twitch account removes it from the public Twitch service. Users can no longer log in to it, and it is no longer discoverable in searches or by direct visits. Important information can be changed manually or deleted by a user before disabling the account so even though the Twitch profile isn't completely deleted from the Twitch database, all the personal information can be.

##  Before You Disable Your Twitch Account 

 Disabling a Twitch account can be done quickly but before you do so, there are some things you should do first.

* **Inform your followers or anyone you are hosting** : If you're a Twitch streamer and you're planning on disabling your account, it's a good idea to inform your viewers in a broadcast in the days leading up to the big day. Make sure to mention when your last broadcast will be and also refer your followers to your other social accounts so that they can stay in touch with you. If you're switching to another streaming site, such as YouTube, ask your viewers to follow or subscribe to those new accounts.
* **Disconnect your other accounts** : One of the cool things about Twitch is that it can connect to other social networks and additional gaming services such as [ Xbox, Steam, and Battle.net](https://www.lifewire.com/top-pc-game-digital-download-services-813065) . It's highly recommended to break the connection to all of these third-party services before disabling your Twitch account so that you can connect them to any new accounts you create in the future. To disconnect these services, go to your **settings** page and click on the **connections** tab. This takes you to a list of connected services that you can disconnect by clicking on the green tick next to their names.
* **Delete personal information** : Because Twitch doesn't fully delete your account, it's a good idea to go into your account settings (via the drop-down menu in the top-right corner) and remove any important information that you want to protect, such as your real name and bio information. It's also recommended to view your channel (from the same menu) and remove all of your custom widgets and links to the various donation services that you may have added.

##  How to Enable a Disabled Twitch Account 

 There isn't a way to manually enable a disabled Twitch account. However, you can do it by emailing Twitch Support. Support usually replies to requests within seven days.

##  Reasons to Disable Your Twitch Account 

 While completely disabling a Twitch account can appear a little extreme, there are several legitimate reasons why some users choose to do so instead of just not logging in anymore. Here are three of the more common ones.

* **Quitting Twitch** : Some users simply decide to stop using Twitch. This can be due to a loss of interest in streaming altogether or even motivated by a shift to a[ rival streaming service such as YouTube](https://www.lifewire.com/youtube-101-3481847) .
* **Multiple Twitch accounts** : Some Twitch users may have created different channels for different audiences (e.g. one for streaming Super Mario Bros video games and another for artwork creation) and now prefer to focus on one or consolidate the two.
* **Too many social accounts** : In addition to potentially having more than one Twitch channel, users can feel that they're using too many social networks in general and may want to cut back. We've all had friends who dramatically announce their departure from Facebook. The same thing happens on other social networks like Twitch.

##  Why You Shouldn't Disable Your Account 

 It may be tempting to disable your Twitch account but there are also several things to consider before doing so.

* **Changing a Twitch username is possible** : If you're disabling your account just to create a new one with a better username, remember that you don't have to do this. It's possible to change your current Twitch account username simply by going to**settings** and clicking on the**edit** option next to the_username_ field.
* **Reserving your brand name** : Even if you're not currently using your Twitch channel, it can be a good idea to keep it online so your fans from other social networks can follow you. This may not be immediately useful, but it will be in the future when you eventually do begin broadcasting. Having an official Twitch channel that's online prevent users from being tricked by potential spam or fake accounts claiming to be you or your company.
* **You can still use your account to watch streams** : Don't forget that you don't need to be streaming on Twitch to be using your account. Plenty of users simply watch other streams and use their accounts to follow, subscribe, and communicate with other channels.
* **Free stuff** ; If you pay for a monthly Amazon Prime subscription then you also have a[ free Twitch Prime membership for your Twitch account](https://www.lifewire.com/use-free-twitch-prime-subscription-4148447) . This premium service gives you several perks, one of which is free digital content for select video game titles. If you disable your Twitch account, you won't be able to take advantage of Twitch Prime.
