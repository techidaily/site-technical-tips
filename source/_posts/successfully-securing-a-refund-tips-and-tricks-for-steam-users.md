## How Do I Download New Apps to My Old Samsung Smart TV?

 If you have an older Samsung smart TV connected to the internet, you should still be able to download new apps. However, there are some exceptions. For example,[Netflix is no longer available on some older Samsung TVs](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Ftroubleshooting%2FTSG01203568%2F) . If the app you want isn't supported on your TV, you'll need to use a dedicated[streaming device](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-streaming-device-5208767) like a Fire TV Stick or Roku to access that app.

 Downloading new apps to an old Samsung TV works the same way it does on a newer TV, but you may have to push a**Smart Hub** or**Internet @TV** button on your remote instead of the Home button. From there, you can select**Apps** or**My Apps** to install something.

## How Do I Install Third-Party Apps on My Samsung Smart TV?

 There's no easy way to put third-party apps on a Samsung TV.
