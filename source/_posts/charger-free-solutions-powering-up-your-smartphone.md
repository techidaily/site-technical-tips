4. Open Google Maps on the main Explore screen.
5. Scroll all the way to the right along the categories and tap**More** .

 On the**Explore** screen, choose the filter icon and set Google Maps to display charging stations by**Relevance** ,**Distance** ,**Rating** , type of**EV plugs** , and**EV charging speed** .
