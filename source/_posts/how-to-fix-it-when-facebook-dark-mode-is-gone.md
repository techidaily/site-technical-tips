## What Is the Shortcut for Split Screen on Mac?

 Having more than one monitor is essential if you regularly work with multiple windows or apps at the same time on your MacBook Air. However, if you don’t have access to an external monitor, macOS has a built-in solution: Split View.

 Split View (or split-screen view) lets you view two apps or windows side-by-side on your MacBook screen without having to resize them or drag windows around manually. This article teaches you what you need to know about this helpful feature, including how to access it and how to swap between different apps while it’s active.

 To launch Split View, follow the steps below:  

1. Hover your mouse over the**Green Circle** (full-screen button) in the left corner of an open window. A drop-down menu should appear.

 Sometimes, exiting full screen will cause one of your windows to disappear. If this happens to you, it’s most likely because something put the window in a separate view in[Mission Control.](https://www.lifewire.com/assign-mac-apps-to-open-in-specific-desktop-space-2260812) On your keyboard, tap**F3** (it looks like a series of rectangles) to open Mission Control, and you should see your lost window in the bar at the top of your screen.

## Why Won't My Mac Do Split Screen?

   1. Click and hold the green circle button.  
   2. The window should shrink. Drag it to the left or right side of the screen.  
   3. Release the button and click a window on the other side of the screen. They should now be arranged side-by-side.  
 If you have macOS Catalina or later installed and still can’t access Split View, make sure it’s enabled by following the steps below:

   9. Select**System Preferences** .
