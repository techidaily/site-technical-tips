While it's true that some of Amazon's best deals drop during the brand's big shopping events, like [Amazon Prime Day](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/october-prime-day-2024-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/), you don't have to wait for a seasonal sale to save across the tech, home, entertainment, and lifestyle categories. 

**Also:** [**October Prime Day 2024: Everything you need to know**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/october-prime-day-2024-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/)

The shopping giant frequently cuts prices on top tech products all year round, including smartwatches, laptops, TVs, appliances, and more. That's why we rounded up the best Amazon deals you can shop this September, even before [October Prime Day](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/october-prime-day-2024-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) makes a return. Check back here each month before you shop -- we'll be updating this list with all the live best deals.

## How did we choose these Amazon deals?

ZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops. 

We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.

## When will these deals expire?

Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on a deal, but don't fret -- we're constantly finding new chances to save and sharing them with you at [ZDNET.com](https://www.zdnet.com/).
