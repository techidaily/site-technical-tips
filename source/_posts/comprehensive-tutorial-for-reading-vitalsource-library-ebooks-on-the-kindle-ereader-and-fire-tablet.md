### How to read VitalSource Bookshelf books on a Kindle eInk Reader?

As a normal practice, VitalSource Bookshelf will NOT work with any e-ink Kindles or any Nook/Kobo devices. However, with the help of [Epubor VitalSource Downloader](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/), you can get your VitalSource books downloaded as DRM-free PDF files which are readable using any device capable of viewing PDF files (assume the original eTextbook delivered by VitalSource is a PDF file). So the VitalSource books are completely at your disposal. It’s up to you on which eInk reader (Kindle/Nook/Kobo) or reading app (Adobe Acrobat/Adobe Digital Editions) to read with. Or you can print these PDFs physically.

#### Steps of converting VitalSource Bookshelf VBK to PDF:

**Step 1.** Download and install Epubor VitalSource Downloader on your computer

Download Epubor VitalSource Downloader for free

Updated 2/18/2019: Epubor Vitalsource Downloader is not available for downloading any more for force majeure. 

**Step 2**. Launch the program, sign in with your VitalSource BookShelf account, and you can see your purchased books are displayed in the library.

**Step 3.** Click on the cover of the book you’d like to download, and it starts to download the book automatically. After downloading the book, it will be saved in PDF file on your computer (on the premise that the original book your purchased from VitalSource is a PDF file). The VitalSource DRM removal and VBK to PDF conversion are processed by the tool simultaneously.

"What does you mean does not work? Can you please describe your problem more clearly so that we can help you fix your problem? Also, you can contact our customer service: support@epubor.com and write down your issue."

 What I think you meant to say is:   
 "I'm sorry to hear that you've encountered difficulties while attempting to use our product. If you could help us by describing your situation with more detail we would be happy to assist you in finding a solution. For a quicker response, please feel free to contact our customer service team at support@epubor.com. If you do choose to contact the customer service team, make sure to give them as much detail as possible so that they are able to assist you in an effective and timely manner."

 If you can't respond to customers in a better tone than what was used in your response then you don't need to be in a customer facing position. Get it together. You're not the only product available.

This worked great for me. After installing it, you launch from a shortcut on your desktop. Then you select "free trial" to log in. You'll have to remember your email and password for your Vital Source account. Depending on what type file your books download as, you may have to use an Epub to Mobi converter.

Okay, so trial version only gives you the first 5 pages. You have to pay for it to actually work.

Thank you for using Epubor software. The trial version will allow you download 5 pages of each book but the licensed version will give you the full content with 1 click.

I use my Vitalsource bookshelf on my computer for school. I downloaded the app on my kindle and tried signing in. Then it asks me " Do you normally access Bookshelf through a link?" I press yes then it says, Accessing bookshelf with a link...... Some user's bookshelf login is tied to a hyperlink, not an email and password. Try finding the link to your originally used to log into Bookshelf, and navigate through that. I have no idea where to find the super link. I signed in through my email address and password.
