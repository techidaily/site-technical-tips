## Mastering PS5 DualSense Repair: Overcoming Challenges with Battery Charging

Close 

 If a PS5 controller won't charge, it's usually because of issues with the charging cable, the controller, or the[ PS5 console](https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-4778089) itself. It can also mean there's an intermittent fault, so the controller sometimes charges or simply only holds a charge for a brief time.

 It's important to narrow down where the issue lies.

##  Why Won't My PS5 Controller Charge?

 When a PlayStation 5 controller refuses to charge, it's usually the charging cable that's the issue. However, it can also be a problem with the connection between the cable and the controller, or even an issue with the connection between the PlayStation 5 console and your controller.

 There are also known issues with the PS5 controller not charging while the console is in rest mode. Most of these problems can usually be fixed at home, but in certain cases, a controller will need Sony's professional repairs or even be beyond fixing. 

 Here are the most common issues you'll run into with a PS5 controller that won't charge:

* **Charging cable** : If your PS5 controller doesn't charge via the charging cable, it may be an issue with the cable. You won't necessarily tell just by looking at it, as the issue may be with the internal wiring.
* **Batteries** : The PS5 controller has an internal battery that can't be removed. If the battery has gone bad and can no longer charge or maintain a charge, it may need to be repaired.
* **Cable connection** : There may be an issue with the connection between the cable and the controller, such as with the controller's port having an issue. It means no power can be transmitted between the two devices.
* **Console issue** : The connection between the console and the cable may be at fault here with an issue with the port or the console's internal connections.
* **Firmware** : If a[ firmware](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-firmware-2625881) update has been interrupted or corrupted, the controller may fail to charge correctly in the future.
* **Internal faults** : Some controllers can fail due to an internal component breaking or wearing out. This is especially true if the device has been dropped, immersed in water, or mishandled in some other way.

##  What to Do if Your PS5 Controller Won't Charge

 Try these troubleshooting tips to get your PS5 controller to work again:

1. Check the charging cable. The PS5 controller has an internal battery, so you need a good cable to get power to it. Check that the cord works with other devices. It's a typical USB charging cable, so you should be able to test it with something like your smartphone to ensure it's working.  
 Alternatively, try it with a different PS5 controller if you have one available to you.
2. Plug the cable into a different USB port. If the charging cable doesn't work via your usual USB port, try a different one. On the PS5, there have been issues with charging controllers in rest mode using the front USB Type-A port. Try using one of the rear ports or even your PC or a USB hub to test it.

###  Tip:
 USB hubs aren't always the most reliable option, so use this as a last resort. If you've tried charging via a USB hub, use a dedicated port instead.

3. Check the port contacts. Look for anything that could be blocking the connection or damaging it in some way. Gently brush any lint or dust out of the way. Along with both sides of the cable, you'll want to check the ports on both the controller and the PlayStation 5.

###  Tip:
 A can of compressed air can help, providing you use it carefully and appropriately.
4. Charge your controller on a charging station. If you own a PS5 charging station, try charging your controller on that instead. It can be more reliable than a cable, which can be damaged easily.
5. [ Update your controller firmware](https://www.lifewire.com/update-ps5-controller-on-pc-8606243) . If your PS5 controller can connect to your console when plugged in, start your console and check for a firmware update. This message will appear automatically when you boot up the console.

 Or, perform an update using your PC or with the PS5 Firmware Update app, pictured above.

6. Check if the issue is with charging or not. Does the controller work when plugged in but not wirelessly? The issue could be with the controller's battery and its ability to hold a charge, rather than the cable.
7. [ Contact PlayStation customer support](https://www.playstation.com/support/contact-us/) . If your controller is still under warranty, PlayStation customer support may be able to help you get it fixed. If it isn't, they can advise you on any other repair options and help you decide what to do next.
