## Additional Dashboard Viewing Features

 If you don't see any Viewers and believe you should, consider these reasons.

* You can only see activity for files owned by a Google account with the Activity Dashboard feature.
* You can only see activity after you have access to the Activity Dashboard.
* The document may have too many views or viewers to display the Activity Dashboard details.
* The people you expect to view the document might have opted out of displaying their View History (see below).
* You or the Admin may have View History turned off (see below).
