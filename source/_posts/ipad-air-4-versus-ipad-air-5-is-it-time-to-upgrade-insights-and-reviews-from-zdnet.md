Apple has wrapped up its [year of iPad releases](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/), which makes now the best time to scope the market and find the right tablet for you. If your heart is set on the thin and lightweight iPad Air model, then your options boil down to this year's [iPad Air (2022)](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi%2Fdp%2FB09V3HN1KC%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cff7b4c72-ce64-4598-99df-8abdf10d6d11%7Cdtp&dtb=1) and its predecessor, the [iPad Air (2020)](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-10-9-inch-Cellular-Generation-Renewed%2Fdp%2FB08PF8HCDJ%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cff7b4c72-ce64-4598-99df-8abdf10d6d11%7Cdtp&dtb=1). I'll refer to the two as iPad Air 5 and iPad Air 4, respectively.

Theoretically, all three upgrades should make a difference in the day-to-day iPad experience. 

But if pricing impacts your buying decision, then the similarly-designed iPad Air 4 is just as worthy of your consideration and can be had for noticeably less money. Read on to learn more about what the defining features are for both models and why you should pick one over the other.

## You should buy the iPad Air 5 (2022) if...

Image: Apple

### 1\. You're ready to embrace Apple's M1 supremacy

The saying you can't teach an old dog new tricks doesn't really apply to the iPad Air 5\. In fact, underneath the familiar glass and aluminum exterior is Apple's ARM-based, eight-core CPU, [M1 processor](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-m1-vs-m2/). Trickling down from MacBooks and iMacs, Apple's M1 chip is expected to be up to 60% faster and more powerful than its A-series counterpart -- like the A14 found in the iPad Air 4\. 

That's a significant step up, considering both iPads start on equal footing with 8GB of RAM. While the iPad Air 5 didn't get Apple's newer [M2 chip](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-apple-m2-chip/), the M1 is still a powerhouse for graphics-intensive apps, such as video editors, 3D racing games, augmented reality, and general multitasking.

### 2\. You want a better front camera and FaceTime experience

Camera performance isn't typically the key selling point for tablets, let alone iPads. But with the iPad Air 5, Apple does emphasize its new and improved front-facing camera.

**Also: [iPad (2022) vs. iPad Air (2022): How different are the two?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-2022-vs-ipad-air-2022/)**

While the 12MP rear camera remains untouched, the front now houses a 12MP ultra-wide camera. With a wider field of view than the previous generation's 7MP FaceTime HD lens, the new iPad can take advantage of Center Stage, Apple's webcam feature that tracks and follows your face as you move around. This is particularly useful for presentations and FaceTime calls with friends and family.

### 3\. You thrive on 5G

Apple didn't leave the possibility of 5G up in the air with the latest iPad model. Though not mmWave 5G, the sub-6 GHz bands on the iPad Air 5 allow you to dial into the 5th-generation network and access faster download speeds than the 4G LTE of the iPad Air 4\. 

You will, of course, need to be under a 5G data plan, have the appropriate nano-SIM card (or [eSIM](https://www.zdnet.com/article/esim-vs-sim-whats-the-difference/)), and purchase the more expensive, cellular version of the iPad, to reap the benefits of the faster network. If you meet the prerequisites and frequently work from outside, then the 5G-enabled iPad is the one to buy.

## You should buy the iPad Air 4 (2020) if...

Image: Apple

### 1\. Price comes before anything else

With the release of the new iPad Air, most third-party retailers have since marked down the 2020 model as a means to clear out inventory. The winner of this sequence is you, the consumer. At the time of writing, the iPad Air 4 can be had for as low as [$429](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-10-9-inch-Cellular-Generation-Renewed%2Fdp%2FB08PF8HCDJ%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cff7b4c72-ce64-4598-99df-8abdf10d6d11%7Cdtp&dtb=1), less if you opt for an open-market retailer like eBay. That's more than a $150 difference compared to the new iPad Air 5 which, in a snapshot, only wins out on 5G, the front-facing camera, and processing power. If one, two, or even all three of those aspects are not on your priority list of features, then opting for the older iPad Air may be the best play here.

## Should I get the iPad Air 4 (2020) or the iPad Air 5 (2022)?

You should buy the iPad Air 5 (2022) if you're looking to upgrade to the Apple M1 chip, you want a better front camera and FaceTime experience, or you want to upgrade to a 5G iPad. You should get the iPad Air 4 (2020) if the price comes before anything else. Many retailers are lowering their prices of the older iPad 4 model to clear inventory, making the 2020 model the more cost-effective iPad of the two.

## Does the Apple Pencil (1st Gen) work with the iPad Air?

The 1st-gen Apple Pencil is not compatible with either of the two iPad Air models mentioned in this article. Instead, you'll have to buy Apple's 2nd-gen stylus, which uses USB-C for charging and pairing, for the newer tablets.

Our [guide to finding the right Apple Pencil and how to pair it](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-pair-and-charge-your-apple-pencil/) breaks down the full list of compatible devices.
