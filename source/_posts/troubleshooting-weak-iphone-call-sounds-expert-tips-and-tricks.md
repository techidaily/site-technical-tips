## How Do I Unhide Hidden Apps?

 You may have[hidden apps on your iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/hide-apps-on-iphone-8584258) in the past because you weren't using them often or you just like a few tidy Home screens.

 Follow these steps to locate a hidden app in the App Library and return it to one of your Home screens.

1. Swipe from right to left on the**Home** screen to Open the App Library.  
 It might be a few screens over, so keep swiping until you see_App Library_ in a search bar at the top of the screen.

2. Tap the search bar in the App Library to view an alphabetical listing of apps. Scroll to the app you want to unhide.  
 Don't remember the exact name of the app you want? Not a problem. You can type one or two letters of the name in the search field and then look through the results that appear until you find what you're looking for.
3. Tap and hold the name of the app you want to unhide.
4. Slide your finger to the left without releasing the app to move it to your home screen, where it and all the rest of the apps on the screen will be jiggling.
5. Continue to slide the app until it is on the Home screen where you want it. Tap**Done** .

## How Do You Find Deleted Apps on iPhone Home Screen?

 If what you want is to find an app that you deleted (not hid) on your iPhone, there's another way to go about it.
6. Open the**App Store** app and tap the**Account** button at the top of the screen. It probably has your picture on it.

7. Select**Purchased** or**My Purchases** (if you set up Family Sharing), and tap the**Not on this iPhone** tab.  
 If you use Family Sharing in iOS 17.4 and higher, access this area from**Apps** \>**My Apps** . Or, tap a family member's name from the Apps screen to redownload apps they purchased.
8. Scroll down and choose the app you want to retrieve. When you find it, tap the download icon next to it to add it to your iPhone.
