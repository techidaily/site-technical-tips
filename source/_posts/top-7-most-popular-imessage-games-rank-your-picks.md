## [Air Hockey With a Twist: Let's Puck It!](https://apps.apple.com/app/lets-puck-it/id1163033961)

![Let's Puck It! app for iMessage](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5vzBEYum7O1TKZFvmHqdHQRaicM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004_best-imessage-games-2018-4176445-eef48fecf87b445f99a3a24e2a82034f.jpg)

 What We Like

* An interesting concept with lots of possibilities.
* A great tool for settling disputes.

 What We Don't Like

* Turn-based play doesn't match excitement of real air hockey.
* Some of the built-in bets are a bit crude.

_Let’s Puck It!_ puts an interesting spin on an old American pastime by encouraging players to wager bets. You can choose from a list of options like “loser buys dinner,” or you can make up your own stakes. Be careful what you wager because the pace of the puck increases with every volley.
