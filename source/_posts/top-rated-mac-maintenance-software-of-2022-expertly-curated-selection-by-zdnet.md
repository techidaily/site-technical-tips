## Top-Rated iPhone SE Cases of 2022: Ultimate Protection & Style Guaranteed

The iPhone SE is one of Apple's most affordable phones still in production. The 2022 model of the phone is a new-and-improved version of the previously released model from 2020, and while the phone itself has changed since its last release, the size of the phone has not. That means all your cases and covers from the 2020 model will fit the 2022 model as well. 

Protecting your iPhone should be a priority, especially considering how much of an investment an iPhone SE is, even if it is a budget-friendly offering from Apple. Putting a case on your iPhone can keep it protected if you drop it or bang it against something. But your case can do more than just protect your phone. Some cases do double duty, like providing power or holding your money. Though there are a lot of phone cases on the market, some stand out against the rest.

### Best for charging on the go

You're not always in a position to be able to charge your phone, especially if you're traveling or out of the house for long periods of time. Having a case that can charge your iPhone SE while you're on the go can be a huge benefit. This Casely Battery-Powered Charging Case comes in a variety of colors to suit whatever aesthetic you're going for with your tech. 

The case has a 3200mAh battery capacity for the iPhone SE and is compatible with both the 2020 and 2022 models, in case you've got the older one. It's also durable enough to offer protection to your phone as well, though it adds a bit of heft because of the battery pack. Just don't forget to charge the case before leaving the house so it functions as you expect it to.

**Pros**

* Will charge your phone on the go
* Variety of colors to choose from

**Cons**

* Makes your phone heavier
* High price tag

## Otter + Pop Symmetry series (build your own case)

### Best for easy handling

With this iPhone SE case created out of a partnership with Otterbox and PopSockets, you not only get protection for your phone but an easy way to hold it. The case is customizable so you can pick the color and PopSocket design. You even get an extra topper to switch out the PopSocket if you choose.

When the PopSocket is popped out, you can prop up the phone or hold it easily in your hand, but it also goes down flush with the case when not in use. With this, you don't have to worry about the PopSocket coming unstuck from your case at any point.

**Pros**

* PopSocket and case all built into one product
* PopSocket won't come unstuck

**Cons**

* Limited designs to choose from
* Can't move the PopSocket to a different spot on the case

## How did we choose these iPhone SE cases?

We selected these iPhone SE cases primarily based on customer ratings. We also chose them based on looking for a variety to suit a large selection of consumer needs, including style and function. We understand that all iPhone users are looking for something different when it comes to protection for their phone, not to mention the need for a variety of price points. We aimed to provide a high-quality recommendation to suit as many people as possible.

## Which iPhone SE case is the right one for you?

When you're trying to figure out what iPhone SE case is for you, first consider if you want it to be more functional than just for protection. If you want something that'll do double duty, one that charges or holds your money might be a better bet than one that doesn't. Also consider how durable you want the case to be. If you're someone who lives or works in an environment where your phone is often at risk of being damaged, a more protective case might be a better option. It's also important to take your budget into account — in more ways than one. You've examined your budget to purchase your phone but now you have to decide how much you want to spend on protecting it. There are a variety of budget-friendly phone cases, but not all of them will offer as much protection as a case that has a higher price tag. Weighing the price with the benefits will help you decide which case is right for you.

## Will an iPhone SE (2022) 3rd generation case fit on an iPhone SE (2020) 2nd generation?

Yes, both the 2020 iPhone SE and the 2022 iPhone SE are the same size, so phone cases between these two models are interchangeable. 

## Will an iPhone SE case fit on an iPhone 8?

Yes, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 7 have the same specs as the iPhone SE.

## Should I put a case on my iPhone SE?

While the choice is yours as to whether or not you put a case on your iPhone SE, keep in mind that a case offers added protection for your very expensive device.

## Do I need a waterproof case for my iPhone SE?

Waterproof cases are certainly not necessary, but consider your lifestyle. If you live near water and are often near it — like if you spend time on a boat or are an avid surfer — a waterproof case could come in handy. It could also be beneficial if you work around water a lot, like if you work in a kitchen or a hair salon.

## Should I put a screen protector on my iPhone SE?

Screen protectors are a great added bit of security for your phone, especially considering how easy it is to shatter an iPhone face. Tempered glass protectors come with some phone cases but can also be purchased separately.
