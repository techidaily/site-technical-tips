[Epubor DRM removal doesn't recognize my Kindle files](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/16/2016 11:15:13 PM 

I sync my Kindle files via Kindle app and get some "fragment files" not azw format. Epubor Kindle DRM removal cannot recognize it. Is this the new format of Kindle files? I just want to decrypt some Kindle files. 

[Not responding](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/18/2016 3:37:55 AM 

When I open Ultimate, it always say "Not responding". I just want to remove DRM from my Kindle files.

[Kindle az3 files](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/27/2016 6:40:15 AM 

I have been successfully decrypting Kindle files before. I recently had one az3 container file that would not decrypt and later another az3 file that did convert but was just blank white pages.

 Is there any way I can get you these files to see what might be done, if anything, to get these to decode? Others are probably seeing this too :)

[Nook to Kindle Paperwhite](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/11/2019 7:12:49 AM 

I'm trying to convert from Nook to Kindle, but my books won't convert. I move them to the right side & a lock with B&N DRM is next to each book. How can I make these books convert to Kindle files?

[Kindle files](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/13/2023 4:56:12 PM 

Can I read Kindle files with this software?

[Re-open de-drm'd files](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/5/2022 10:28:29 PM 

I have successfully removed drm from kindle files using Epubor ultimate. I have a Mac with Monterrey, but used kindle for Mac 1.31 and the terminal command, and all went well. However, Kindle will not re-open these files, which are .azw3 files. I've converted to .mobi but still kindle won't open them, they just crash the app. What's going on??? Thanks.

[where are the pdf files stored on my computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/2/2023 4:05:49 PM 

where are the pdf files stored on my computer after conversion from kindle files? Can I choose to convert all kindle files at once to pdf? Rather than just clicking one at a time? Jow can I delete the pdf files converted after I have finished using them? This question about deleting the files relates to first being able to locate where they are being stored on my pc.

[Kindle Transfer doesnt' recognize my e-reader](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/reader/) \-- 9/21/2023 7:00:31 AM 

Hi there,

 I'm looking for some help, I just purchased the Epubor kindle transfer to convert kindle files for my kobo, but the program doesn't recognize my Kobo when it's plugged in. My computer recognizes it but Kindle Transfer does not.

 Help!  

[I thought ULTIMATE would include all your software](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 8/26/2023 2:58:51 AM 

I thought your Epubor Ultimate lifetime license did it all - not you have additional software to remove newer kindle drm etc and the upgrade is not included in ultimate?   
 I really understood that the ultimate purchase would include all that - even with changes over the years. I bought it to deal with kindle files and now it doesn't work for the newer files that they are converting most of their books to.  
 I feel you are not holding to your offering.

[Program Freezes on Kindle files](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/27/2024 10:24:12 AM 

I am testing the Free Trial version.

 epubor detects the books on my Kindle accurately. Program is set to convert to epub

 I drag and drop a book, msg comes up saying to wait while DRM is removed 0%. Popup stays there, no progress.

 Tried it on multiple books, gave it a lot of time.

 Nothing can be done in epubor when this occurs. Only way to exit it is to kill it from Task Manager. Running Windows 10
