## M2 vs M3 MacBook Air Face-Off: Which Apple Laptop Reigns Supreme? Insights

![Apple MacBook Air M3](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/fade22d2af84b0fb82abcf1af4fc650ac0856a25/2024/03/04/6571c255-430c-471b-a84f-c8b5526cd7cf/dsc09975-2.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

The [MacBook Pro got an M3 chip upgrade](https://www.zdnet.com/article/m3-macbook-pro-buying-advice/) in November 2023, and the MacBook Air followed in March 2024\. Apple claims the [MacBook Air with an M3](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air%2F13-inch-m3&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) is up to 60% faster than the M1 chip version.

You may be wondering if the M3 MacBook Air is worth the upgrade. Unfortunately, the answer here isn't as clear as it may usually be.

First, if you need help deciding whether you need a MacBook Pro or a MacBook Air, [check out our guide](https://www.zdnet.com/article/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-how-to-decide/). If you _do_ want an Air, read on.

In many cases, if you own the previous generation of an Apple device, it's often not worth upgrading. It might be if you're skipping a generation or entering the ecosystem for the first time. With the [MacBook Air M3](https://www.zdnet.com/article/m3-macbook-air-review/), though, there are a few major additions that might warrant a leap from the M2\. If you have an M1 or older, you have even more reasons to upgrade.

Want a little help deciding? Here's a breakdown of the biggest differences between the M3 MacBook Air and the M2 MacBook Air, plus a few key reasons to buy each one.

###  1\. You want the fastest Wi-Fi support available

If you find yourself doing a lot of downloading for work, or you're a gamer, the MacBook Air with M3 features the new [Wi-Fi 6e standard](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/wi-fi-6e-the-future-of-wireless-connectivity-today-with-some-caveats/) that provides faster download speeds and lower latency -- provided you're using a Wi-Fi 6e router, of course. While you might not notice much of a difference for everyday tasks, if you do Wi-Fi-intensive tasks where latency is critical, you'll quickly appreciate the upgrade.

###  2\. You use more than one monitor

One of the biggest advantages of the M3, aside from the purely technical upgrades, is dual monitor support. While there are workarounds to use two monitors on the M2, they have some drawbacks and don't increase the actual number of display outputs supported by the hardware.

The M3 MacBook Air has [full connectivity](https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-use-your-m3-macbook-pro-with-dual-monitors-now-just-like-the-m3-macbook-air/) for two [external monitors](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/apple-studio-display-monitor-review/), so if you frequently work with more than one monitor, it's certainly worth upgrading. There is a small catch in that you can only use two external monitors while the laptop lid is closed. So you don't get your laptop's display _and_ two monitors; you just get the monitors.

###  3\. You want the absolute best performance

The biggest difference between the M2 and M3 models is in the chip that runs the laptops. If you want the very best performance, especially for new AI applications, look to the M3\. There are several versions of the M3 chip, and while MacBook Air laptops only come with the base version, it's a very large upgrade over the M1 or an older Intel-powered Air.

If you do intensive work like video editing or graphic design and find your older machine bogging down often, you'll likely notice the difference in rendering and boot-up speed immediately. The increase over the M2 isn't as significant, but if you're someone who wants or needs the very best laptop available for the money, it's enough to consider.

##  You should buy the M2 MacBook Air if...

Cliff Joseph/ZDNET

###  1\. The $100 price difference means a lot

You don't get too many chances to save money on Apple products, but you have one here by opting for the M2 version of the MacBook Air. With the release of the M3 version. Apple has dropped the M2 MacBook Air's starting price to $999, but that price could drop further later in the year, opening the door for bigger savings. Even though the M2 is slightly older, it's still a perfectly capable laptop that will work fine for most people.

###  2\. You don't need the latest and greatest features

Will you be mainly using your laptop for web surfing, streaming, listening to music, or working a remote job? If so, then you probably don't need the power -- and price tag -- of the M3 MacBook Air. For most users, the M2 is a more than reliable machine. It was ZDNET's [2022 product of the year](https://www.zdnet.com/article/m2-macbook-air-zdnets-product-of-the-year/)!

**Also:** [**I recommend this 15-inch MacBook Air to most people, and it's still $250 off**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-recommend-this-15-inch-macbook-air-to-most-people-and-its-still-250-off/)

### 3\. You're expecting the M3 to be a bigger upgrade

If you were expecting a radical redesign with the latest MacBook, you won't get it from the M3 Air. It looks nearly identical to the M2, and aside from the anodization seal on the midnight color that reduces fingerprints, even the colors aren't anything new. The real changes are on the inside, so if you want something that simply looks like it's the latest thing, you won't get any benefit from picking the M3 over the M2\.
