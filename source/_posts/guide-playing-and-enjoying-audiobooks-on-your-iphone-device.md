More and more people choose to listen to audiobook instead of reading ebooks or physical books these days. Why the most common answer would be I don't get enough time. And to some extent this is true. Life is busy. And to listen to an audiobook on your iPhone, you first have to purchase the audiobook, and where you purchase it determines how you listen to it. You can buy audiobooks from iBooks or Audible.com, or download free audiobooks from Librivox and AudioBooksforFree.com or borrow audiobooks from the public library using Overdrive. So I am going to mainly introduce two powerful audiobook iOS apps for you. 

### 1\. Listening to Audiobook on iPhone via iBook

iBooks is an e-book application for Apple iOS and Mac OS operating systems and devices. You can use iBooks to buy and download books, manage your purchases, organize your library and find audiobooks in the iBooks app on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, and in iTunes on a Mac or PC. 

iBooks supports the ePub file format, iBooks Author books, PDFs, MP3 audiobooks, AAC audiobooks, and Audible.com audiobooks. If you want to add books, audiobooks, and PDFs that you didn't buy from the iBooks Store, iTunes Store, or Audible.com to iBooks, they must be DRM-free.

#### 1.1 Get audiobooks from the iBooks Store

 When you're in the iBooks app, you can browse books by Featured, Top Charts, or Search for a specific title. Tap any audiobook you're interested in to learn more about the book, read reviews, or see related titles. If a sample is available, tap **Sample**on the right side of the screen to read a few pages. 

To buy a book, tap the **price** on the right side of the screen, then tap **Buy**. 

To get a free book, tap **Get** on the right side of the screen, then tap **Get Book**. 

To find a book you've purchased in the past, or to get the latest version of a book you own, tap **Purchased**. 

#### 1.2 Listen to audiobooks on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch

In the iBooks app, tap a book cover to start listening. When you stop listening, iBooks remembers where you stopped and and starts there the next time that you return to your audiobook. 

If you would like iBooks to remember where you left off on your other devices, turn on **Settings iBooks Sync Bookmarks and Notes**.

#### 1.3 Access your audiobooks on all of your devices

Before you can access your audiobooks on all of your devices, make sure that you're signed in to all of them with the same Apple ID. Audiobooks that you buy from the iBooks Store or iTunes Store are automatically available in the iBooks app on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch using iOS 9 and later, and in iTunes on a computer with iTunes 12.4 or later. 

If you use **iCloud Drive**, you can access your imported ePub, iBook Author books and PDFs across all of your devices. 

You can also manually **sync Audiobooks** that you didn't buy from the iTunes Store using iTunes and USB. 

**Note**: You might not be able to redownload a previous purchases if the item is no longer available from the iBooks Store or iTunes Store.
