 Printable sign language charts are good for instant reference. Put a few in your pocket, place them around the house, or spend some time memorizing them to learn offline.

* [Start ASL's free sign language chart](https://www.startasl.com/free-sign-language-chart/) : This resource provides images of comon words like "what," "how," "hungry," "bathroom," "woman," and "food" being signed. Instructions for how to sign are below most of them.
* [Lifeprint's alphabet fingerspelling](http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/wallpaper1.htm) : Print these two sets of pictures to learn the alphabet. Both sets have the letters on the hands, but they also have a version without the letters for practice.
* [These numbers/common words/letters](https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/language-language-arts/learning-languages/american-sign-language/signing-for-dummies-cheat-sheet-208315/) : This cheatsheet is similar to the other printables here with four images you can print for keywords, such as "how," "which," "where," "yes," "please," "thanks," "goodbye," etc. There are also printables for the alphabet and numbers one through 10.
* [Print individual letters in sign language](https://www.teachersprintables.net/category/sign%5Flanguage) : These printables includes large letters of the alphabet represented in sign language.
