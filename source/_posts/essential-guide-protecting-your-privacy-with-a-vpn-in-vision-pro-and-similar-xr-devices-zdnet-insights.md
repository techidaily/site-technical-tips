## Essential Guide: Why Every iPhone 16 Owner Should Consider Using a Protective Case - Insights and Tips for First-Time Users

![iPhone 16 Pro in Desert Titanium](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/000115dac1fd50c0d82f77d5f4bbb47d3e6ca1ce/2024/09/09/2dc0c5c5-be47-4ac7-b68d-9335f266f356/dsc01931.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

It's that time of year again -- [iPhone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/) upgrade season.

For those of you who rose at the crack of dawn and placed your order in what I like to call the festival of "Rush-iPhone-Ah" (also known as the great Apple harvest), you might have obsessed over which color to get. 

**Also: [I went hands-on with iPhone 16 Pro - my 3 favorite features of Apple's pocket supercomputer](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-iphone-16-pro-my-3-favorite-features-of-apples-pocket-supercomputer/)**

Well, I didn't. Why? Because I'm throwing mine in a case, that's why. I ordered my [iPhone 16 Pro Max](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) in natural titanium -- the easiest color to snag -- and I didn't want to wait an extra month for delivery.

## Do you need a case? Absolutely

Not using a case almost guarantees you'll damage your device the first time you drop it. Maybe you've been one of the lucky ones who's never cracked a screen. If so, congratulations -- you've defied the odds. But the [iPhone 16 lineup](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-which-iphone-should-you-buy-today/) introduces new risks, and you might not be so lucky this time.

**Also: [I maxed out my iPhone 16 Pro Max preorder. How much it cost me](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-maxed-out-my-iphone-16-pro-max-preorder-heres-how-much-it-cost-me/)**

The iPhone 16 series has the narrowest bezels we've ever seen, giving users more screen real estate and a sleek, immersive design. However, the slimmer bezels also mean the edges are more exposed, making your [smartphone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/) more vulnerable to damage from drops. Compared to the iPhone 15's 1.55mm bezels, the iPhone 16 has 1.2mm bezels, increasing the risk of screen impacts.

Those upgrading from the iPhone 12 or iPhone 13 will notice an even more dramatic change. The iPhone 12 series had 3.47mm bezels, and the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 had slightly thinner bezels, but they were still wider than those of the iPhone 16.

**Also: [iPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 13 Pro: Should you upgrade?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-vs-iphone-13-pro-should-you-upgrade-to-apples-latest-model/)**

If you're coming from one of these older models, you'll be adjusting to a significantly more exposed display, making the need for a protective case and glass screen protector even more crucial.

## My top picks for iPhone 16 cases

### OtterBox

OtterBox Defender Pro Series

OtterBox

The [OtterBox Defender Series Pro](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9041660-15734810?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fdefender-series%3Fprefn1%3DcompatibleWith%26prefv1%3DiPhone%252016%257CiPhone%252016%2520Plus%257CiPhone%252016%2520Pro%257CiPhone%252016%2520Pro%2520Max&sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) ($64.95) is one of the most protective options available. Whether you are an iPhone or [Android](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-phone/) user, the Defender has been my top recommended phone case for those with active lifestyles for many years.

**Also: [The best iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro cases of 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-16-case/)**

The classic clamshell design, combined with rubber reinforcement, ensures heavy-duty protection. The 2024 version for the iPhone 16 is also [MagSafe](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-battery/) compatible for the first time, making it ideal for those needing maximum protection with magnetic charging convenience. It increases drop protection to 7 times as many drops as the military standard (MIL-STD-810G 516.6).

For a slightly lighter alternative, the [Defender Series Pro XT for MagSafe](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9041660-15734810?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fheavy-duty-iphone-16-pro-case-red%2F77-96094.html&sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) ($69.95) offers excellent protection and has clear versions with colored bumpers. If you're looking for something even lighter, the [Symmetry](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9041660-15734810?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fsymmetry-series-with-camera-control&sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) and [Commuter](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9041660-15734810?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fcommuter-series&sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) cases are fine options, though better suited for more careful users. Symmetry is also compatible with adjustable OtterBox 2-in-1 [Crossbody Straps](https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/crossbody-2-in-1-crossbody-strap-black/77-96840.html), which can convert to wrist straps to carry your phone within easy reach. 

### Nomad

Nomad Rugged Case for iPhone 16 Pro Max

Nomad

The [Nomad Rugged](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-9041660-15735858%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnomadgoods.com%252Fproducts%252Frugged-case-desesrt-iphone-16-pro-max%26sid%3Dzd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp) case ($60) is built for maximum protection, with a shock-absorbing bumper designed to handle drops. It's not as bulky as the OttterBox Defender but still an extremely strong and protective case.

**Also: [Apple just gave me a compelling reason to buy the smaller iPhone 16 Pro over the Max this year](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-just-gave-me-a-compelling-reason-to-buy-the-smaller-iphone-16-pro-over-the-max-this-year/)**

Add a magnetic leather back attachment without sacrificing durability if you want a premium feel. 

The [Modern Leather](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-9041660-15735858%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnomadgoods.com%252Fproducts%252Fmodern-leather-case-rustic-brown-horween-iphone-16-pro-max%26sid%3Dzd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp) case ($70) has a hard plastic shell that also integrates leather but isn't as robust as the Rugged. 

**Also: [iPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 13 Pro: Should you upgrade to Apple's latest model?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-vs-iphone-13-pro-should-you-upgrade-to-apples-latest-model/)**

For a lighter option, the **[Nomad Sport](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-9041660-15735858%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnomadgoods.com%252Fproducts%252Fsport-case-naval-blue-iphone-16-pro-max%26sid%3Dzd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp)** ($50) offers durable protection without bulk but lacks bumper reinforcement.

### UAG

UAG Monarch Pro in red

Urban Armor Gear

The [UAG Monarch Pro](https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=app&ti=1019&mi=20033&pw=262625&ctc=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.urbanarmorgear.com%2Fproducts%2Fmonarch-pro-for-magsafe-iphone-16-pro-max-case%2F) case ($79.95) offers military-grade protection with reinforced corners, but there's significant pricing variation with [many SKUs and color configurations](https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=app&ti=1019&mi=20033&pw=262625&ctc=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.urbanarmorgear.com%2Fcollections%2Fiphone-16-pro-max%2F). 

So, be selective when choosing the right version for your needs.

### Spigen

Spigen Core Armor Magfit for iPhone 16 Pro Max

Spigen

Spigen's [Tough Armor](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpigen-Kickstand-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0D21RQK6X%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C45a7acc0-1669-455d-8412-4a0521931ce4%7Cdtp&dtb=1) line is a reliable choice for protection at a reasonable price. Their [Core Armor](https://www.spigen.com/collections/iphone-16-series-case-collection/products/iphone-16-series-case-core-armor?variant=43175855718447) ($29) and [Rugged Armor MagFit](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpigen-Designed-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0D222B153%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C45a7acc0-1669-455d-8412-4a0521931ce4%7Cdtp&dtb=1) ($39) are standout options, with the Rugged Armor MagFit also being MagSafe compatible. 

These cases offer excellent value without adding excessive bulk.

### ESR

ESR Cyber Tough for iPhone 16 Pro Max (Blue)

ESR

ESR's economical [Cyber Tough Case](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1200223&u=4338022&m=80610&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fjrkzxp) ($29) is their most durable offering, with reinforced corners and shock absorption. 

Its Stash Stand is an integrated, fold-out kickstand that doubles as a camera protection ring. 

**Also: [I demoed Apple's standard iPhone 16 and didn't envy the Pro models at all](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-demoed-apples-standard-iphone-16-and-didnt-envy-the-pro-models-at-all/)**

The case also supports MagSafe via HaloLock, making it versatile for charging and mounting.

## Why a glass protector is also a must

Even with a case, your iPhone 16's screen is more vulnerable than ever. With bezels so close to the edge, a case alone won't protect against scratches, cracks, or the dreaded spider-web shatter after a fall. 

A tempered glass screen protector is your next essential line of defense. Here's my top three choices:

### OtterBox Premium Pro, Premium, and OtterBox Glass

OtterBox offers three tiers of protection for the iPhone 16: [Premium Pro](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9041660-15734810?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fiphone-16-pro-max-screen-protector%3Fprefn1%3Dname2%26prefv1%3DPremium%2520Pro%2520Glass&sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [Premium](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9041660-15734810?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fiphone-16-pro-max-screen-protector%3Fprefn1%3Dname2%26prefv1%3DPremium%2520Pro%2520Glass&sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), and the entry-level [OtterBox Glass](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9041660-15734810?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fiphone-16-pro-max-screen-protector%3Fprefn1%3Dname2%26prefv1%3DOtterBox%2520Glass&sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). The Premium Pro provides enhanced scratch resistance and impact absorption, while Premium offers solid protection at a slightly lower price point. OtterBox Glass is a more affordable entry-level option, providing basic protection.

### ESR Tempered Glass Screen Protector

ESR's [Tempered Glass Screen Protector](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1200223&u=4338022&m=80610&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fzonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io%2Fb0rbxy) is one of the most affordable options available, and it comes in a 3-pack. With 9H hardness and edge-to-edge protection, this protector provides excellent defense against scratches and drops. The easy installation system ensures a bubble-free fit, making it a great budget-friendly choice without compromising quality.

### Spigen Glas.tR EZ Fit

The [Spigen Glas.tR EZ Fit](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpigen-Tempered-Screen-Protector-Designed%2Fdp%2FB0C9RX4MLV%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C45a7acc0-1669-455d-8412-4a0521931ce4%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is available in a 2-pack and features an easy installation system that reduces the hassle of bubbles or misalignment. It offers 9H hardness for scratch and impact protection, keeping the screen clear and responsive. Additionally, Spigen offers a privacy-enhanced version for users who want added privacy, priced just a few dollars higher than the standard model.

## Final thoughts

The iPhone 16 series's slimmer bezels and larger screens increase the importance of protecting your device. Whether you opt for the rugged durability of an OtterBox Defender, the sleek design of a Nomad Rugged, or the affordable protection of an ESR case and screen protector, investing in strong cases and tempered glass is a must to keep your device safe from accidental drops and scratches.

 A small investment now can save you from costly repairs later.
