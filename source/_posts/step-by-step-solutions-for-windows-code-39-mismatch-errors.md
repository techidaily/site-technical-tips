2. Tap**Copy** to copy the FaceTime web address to your device’s clipboard, and then paste it into an email or text to send to a contact or yourself. Alternatively, you can tap one of the suggested apps to send the link there.

## Do I Need to Install FaceTime on My Windows Computer?

 There is no FaceTime app for Windows computers, nor do you need one. On Windows, FaceTime can be run completely from within a web browser by clicking a chat invite link sent from someone with an Apple device.  

 You can't start a FaceTime chat on a Windows computer. You’re only able to join an existing one created on an Apple device.

## Is FaceTime for PC Safe?

 Apple does promise[end-to-end encryption](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-end-to-end-encryption-4028873) for its FaceTime communications which increases your conversation’s privacy significantly.

 You can increase your security by making sure you have the latest version of Windows running on your computer and ensuring that your browser is up to date. It’s also a good idea to only click FaceTime invite links you’re expecting. Email scammers may try to trick you into clicking malicious links by claiming they’re for a FaceTime chat when in reality, they’re for a fake website.
