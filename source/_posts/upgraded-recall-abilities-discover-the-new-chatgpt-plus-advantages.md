## Upgraded Recall Abilities: Discover the New ChatGPT Plus Advantages

If you have the paid version of ChatGPT, it's probably the most solid generative AI chatbot out there. GPT-4 is still robust, with pre-trained add-ons help you tweak your experience, and OpenAI is constantly improving it. This latest addition might be one of the most useful to date, especially if you tend to repeat stuff to it frequently throughout multiple conversations.

[ChatGPT Plus](https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-effective-methods-to-fake-gps-location-on-android-for-your-vivo-y78t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/) has now rolled out a new "Memory" feature, after [previously rolling out to a limited number of ChatGPT users](https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/effortless-remedies-to-tackle-the-0-hurdle-in-updating-windows-successfully/) as a test. It's a persistent memory bank that will allow ChatGPT to learn specific facts about yourself, and reuse them throughout different conversations. The idea of this is that if you want ChatGPT to remember things about you, you can just write it down in the chatbot. Whenever appropriate, the AI will reference that memory bank and use the data it learned about you in other conversations as well. The example showed by OpenAI is of a user telling the chatbot about their petsâ€”ChatGPT stored that in the memory bank, and in a separate conversation, it used those details when the user asked it to generate "pictures of their pets." Pretty cool.

 Previously, the only way to get ChatGPT to reference something you told it previously was to make your new query within that same chat. You can check out whatever ChatGPT's memory has on you by checking the "Manage memories" section in a dropdown within the chat's interface, and if you want, you can remove certain things, or wipe it completely, whenever you want. The feature can also be completely turned off in Settings.

 It should be noted that the feature is not available just yet in Europe and South Korea (perhaps because of privacy concerns) and it's not clear whether it will be rolling out at a later date. Otherwise, it will be rolling out to all ChatGPT Plus users, so if you're subscribed to the premium tier of the chatbot, make sure to check it out and give it a spin. OpenAI says that it will be coming to Team and Enterprise users soon, as well as to GPTs.
