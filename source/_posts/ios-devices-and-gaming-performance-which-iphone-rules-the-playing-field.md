 Look no further if you want high-end performance and a dazzling screen. The[ iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-15-5202683) is close to the top of the iPhone lineup, which means it offers the most powerful processor of any iPhone (the A17 Pro), the best screen, and the highest[ GPU](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-gpu-5226033) performance.

 You're probably a casual gamer if you don't know what a GPU or an AAA game is. And there's nothing wrong with that! Casual gamers are by far the biggest group of gamers. So, whether you like to play word or puzzle games, do a bit of card playing or candy crushing, or dabble in RPGs or first-person shooters, you don't need to buy a high-end phone.  

 That's where the[ iPhone 13 Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-13-vs-iphone-13-pro-6543140) comes in. It's been on the market for a few years now, so it lets you strike a nice balance between an excellent gaming phone and one that costs less than the latest models (prices start around $500, around $400 less than the iPhone 15 Pro). Prices vary as Apple no longer sells this model; you must buy it from third-party stores. Expect to spend around $500-$600.

 The iPhone 13 Pro offers a terrific screen, strong performance, and lots of storage—along with all the key iPhone features and functionality that make it an excellent smartphone. It's a bit heavy, so playing games for a long time may tire your hands or arms, but most casual gamers don't play for hours anyway.

 If you want a phone that's a bit newer, consider the iPhone 15 (prices start around $799).

 If you're a casual gamer whose decision is primarily motivated by price, consider the[ iPhone SE (3rd Generation)](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-se-5206919) . This model balances all the key considerations: it's a suitable device for casual gaming with useful iPhone features, and its price starts at just $429.

 This version of the iPhone SE was released in late 2022, so its features are naturally a bit behind other recent models. If your gaming consists of puzzles, card games, and word games like crossword puzzles, the SE is a great pick. Its screen is small compared to the ones listed above, but its price reflects any shortcomings. It's an excellent option for the budget-conscious gamer.
