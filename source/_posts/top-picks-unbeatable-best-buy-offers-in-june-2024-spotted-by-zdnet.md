## How did we choose these Best Buy deals?

To find the best deals, we scoured the entire Best Buy website, searching through thousands of various products to bring you the best deals. 

We chose our favorite Best Buy deals based on the following factors:

* **Price**: While looking for the best deals, we focused on products with an attractive discount. Additionally, we use price trackers to ensure that you are actually getting a great deal, removing any items with 'original' price inflation in order to look like a deal.
* **Availability**: ZDNET has included deals with good general availability and we have avoided deals when there are only a handful of products still in stock. However, stock levels may have changed since the time of publication.
* **Variety**: We wanted to include a range of tech products and accessories, whether you're looking for a new iPad or a modern kitchen appliance. We also ensured our picks matched a variety of budgets.
* **Customer reviews**: While we considered the best Best Buy deals, we took a look at customer reviews and ratings to recommend the best deals and devices.
