## Fix 1: Disable audio enhancements in Windows

 Audio enhancement packages are aimed to enhance your audio performance. But this feature sometimes causes problems with audio and sound. If you encounter any audio issues, you can try disabling audio enhancements.

Here’s how:

 1) In the right-bottom toolbar, right-click on the volume icon and select**Open Sound settings** .  
  
![open sound settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/open-sound-settings.png)

 2) Click**Sound Control Panel** on the right side of the window.

![sound control panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sound-control-panel.png)

 3) In the**Playback** tab, double-click on the speaker you’re currently using.  
 (Or you can choose the device and then click**Properties** .)  
  
![speaker priority](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/double-click-on-the-speaker.png)

 4) In the Properties window, select the**Enhancements** tab. Then check the option**Disable all enhancements** .  
  
![disable all enhancements speaker](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/disable-all-enhancements-1.png)

 5) Select the**Advanced** tab. Click on the down arrow and choose the first value**16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)** on the list.  
  
![default format](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/advanced-tab.png)

 Once done, simply click**Apply > OK** . This should reduce audio dropouts. If it didn’t help you solve the issue, proceed to the next fix.

## Fix 2: Update your audio driver

 The audio issue in your game may indicate that you’re using an audio driver that is out of date. If you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, then definitely do it now as this would fix your issue right away.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [**automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your audio driver

 You can update your audio driver manually via Device Manager or go to your device’s manufacturer’s official website to download and install the correct driver for your system.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2: Automatically update your audio driver (recommended)

 Updating drivers manually can be time-consuming because you need to find out the correct driver corresponding with your system. So if you are not comfortable doing this on your own, we recommend **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  as your great pick.

 It’s a useful tool that **automatically** detects any outdated drivers, then downloads and installs the latest drivers for your system. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.

Here’s how it works:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![update drivers automatically with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/scan-now-9-available.jpg)

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

## Fix 3: Verify your game files

 If updating the audio driver didn’t help you solve the issue, it could be that your game files are corrupted. This would happen either on an update installation for Fortnite or even just when changing your rendering mode. So to ensure this isn’t the case, you should verify your game files.

 1) Navigate to the game in your**Library** . Then click on the**three dots** . Once open, click**Verify** in the drop-down navigation.  
  
![Fortnite verify game files in Epic Games Launcher](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/verify-game-files.png)

 Depending on the size of the game, it may take a few minutes to verify all your files. Once it completes, click**Launch** to start your game.

## Fix 4: Disable fullscreen optimizations & high DPI scaling

 Fullscreen optimization is a Windows 10 feature designed to improve your PCs performance during gaming sessions. But there are certain games that are particularly affected by low FPS issues when players enable fullscreen optimizations. And when this feature is enabled, you may encounter other issues including the delayed audio or audio cutting out. To fix it, you should disable it.

 1) Open your game’s installation folder. It should be in C: drive > Program Files > Epic Games > Fortnite > Binaries > Win64.

 2) Navigate to**FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.dll** . Right-click it and select**Properties** .  
  
![disable fullscreen optimizations Fortnite](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/disable-fullscreen-optimiztions.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Select the tab**Compatibility** tab. Check the option**Disable fullscreen optimizations** . Then click**Change high DPI settings** .  
  
![disable fullscreen optimizations Fortnite](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/check-disable-fullscreen-optimizations.png)

 4) Check the option**Override high DPI scaling behavior** and then click**OK** .  
  
![disable high DPI scaling Fortnite](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/disable-high-DPI-scaling-behaviro.png)

 5) Click**Apply > OK** to save the changes.  
  
![save the changes](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apply-the-changes.png)

 Now do the same with**FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping\_BE** ,**FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping\_EAC** and**FortniteLauncher** .

## Fix 5: Set priority to normal

 To fix the audio issues in the game, you need to ensure that Fortnite is running at a normal priority. If you set the priority to high, your game would probably be stuttering and it can induce audio dropouts. To make sure that’s not your case, take these steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Type**taskmgr** and press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/set-Steams-priority-to-high-in-the-Task-Manager-to-help-with-the-unpacking-speed.jpg)

 3) Under the Processes tab, navigate to the**Fortnite** application. Right-click it and select**Go to details** . (Make sure that you have the game open, otherwise you won’t be able to see the Fortnite application under the tab.)

 4) You’ll be directed to the**Details** tab and**FortniteClient-Win64** is highlighted. Right-click it and select**Set priority > Normal** .
