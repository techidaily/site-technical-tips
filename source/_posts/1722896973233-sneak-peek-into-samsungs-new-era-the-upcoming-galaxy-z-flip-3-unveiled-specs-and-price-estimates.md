## When Will the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Be Released?

 Samsung's phones are on an annual release cycle, so the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 release date is almost guaranteed to mimic the upcoming[Galaxy Z Flip 6](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-8621840) . That means Samsung will offer up the Z Flip 7 in 2025, most likely alongside the Z Fold 7.

 The other clue that this phone is on the horizon is that[the company has already registered the Galaxy Z Flip 7 name](https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-has-already-secured-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-flip-7-names/) .

## Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Price Rumors

 This phone won't come out for over a year, and the 2024 Z Flip isn't here yet, so it's too early to predict its price accurately. For now, we'll refer to the pricing of the Z Flip 5 as a benchmark. Assuming Samsung introduces a new 1 TB model, here's a potential pricing breakdown for the Samsung Z Flip 7:

* Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 (256 GB): $999.99
* Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 (512 GB): $1,119.99
* Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 (1 TB): $1,219.99

 There might also be a more affordable model called the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE (Fan Edition). It would feature cheaper hardware, but the exact pricing details aren't yet known. Our guess is somewhere around $750.

## Pre-Order Information

 Pre-orders for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 are expected to begin immediately after the phone's announcement during[Samsung Unpacked](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-unpacked-news-and-rumors-5093153) , likely around July 2025\. We will provide the pre-order link here when it becomes available.

## Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Features

 Next year's Galaxy Z Flip phone will run[One UI](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-samsung-one-ui-4178405) on top of[Android 15](https://www.lifewire.com/android-15-7547471) . That version of Android hasn't been released just yet, but it will be available in time for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7\. We expect to see satellite messaging and a slew of AI features.

 We'll know a lot more about what's coming to this phone after Samsung debuts the Z Flip 6, so be sure to check back then.

## Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Specs and Hardware

 The latest Galaxy Z Flip phone features a main camera and an ultra-wide-angle camera. Based on[patents suggesting what Samsung is developing](https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-7/) , the Z Flip 7 might introduce the lineup's first telephoto camera. Another change is that the camera setup is stacked vertically instead of horizontally.

 Unlike digital zoom, a telephoto camera lets you zoom in on faraway objects without losing image quality. It's good for taking clear photos of things like wildlife from a distance. It also helps create that blurry background you see in professional portraits.

 Currently, Samsung uses blue fluorescent materials in their displays, but this may change with the Galaxy Z Flip 7.[The company is reportedly working on a PHOLED solution](https://wccftech.com/galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-could-be-the-first-phones-to-use-blue-pholed/) (phosphorescent[OLED](https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091) ), aiming to switch to a more efficient blue phosphorescent material, a change that has the potential to improve power efficiency.
