After you gathered a ton of ebooks in epub format (from Google, Kobo, B&N, Sony and another online ebook stores or bookshelves) and you try reading these epub files on your kindle, you need to add epub to kindle. You know, ePub, as one of the standard ebook formats, free and open-source, makes it easy to read books in epub on multiple devices, and even possible to share epub books between different eReaders--but Amazon Kindle, the big player of eBooks and eReaders provider, doesn't support epub format. So adding epub to kindle is not so easy as you think!

 Hope you can get a better understanding and take action soon after this reading.

* [Part 3: Add epub to Kindle app](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Why we have to do this

Why we have to add ePub to Kindle? This is just because we want to read epub on kindle!

Just a joke, but this is the direct reason and purpose, yes? If we don't add to kindle, how can we read?

But I have said that our Kindle is not compatible with the EPUB format. So this is the truly reason that stops us adding epub to kindle. In other words, though we can transfer epub files to kindle device, we will still can't open them. This makes our adding job meaningless.

Furtherly, here you may want to ask me why? Why kindle doesn't support epub? Sorry I think only Amazon can answer it, but I still show some objective reasons to you.

\--Kindle only supports ebooks purchased from Amazon Kindle store.  
 \--Kindle supports personal files with doc, pdf, txt, jpeg, png and mobi.   
 format, but it still doesn't support EPUB.  
 \--Most of EPUB files purchased from other stores are with DRM protection, which also prevents us reading epub on non-specified devices, such as Kindle.

To sum up, Kindle prevents us from reading epub, and epub's providers also stop us reading epub on Kindle. So if we desire successfully epub to kindle adding, we must get rid of the drm and format limitation.

### How to add ePub to Kindle

Have got the reason, this part will guide you through a common solution to add epub to Kindle.

The Tool You need:

* [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)
* [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions/download.html)

#### Step 1: Get ePub files prepared.

Gather all your downloaded epub books together on your computer please, no matter they are from google play books or kobo store. If your epub files are saved in your another device such as kobo ereader or android tablet, please connect them to your computer and then transfer epub to computer.

#### Step 2: Read EPUB in Adobe Digital Editions.

On your computer please install Adobe Digital Editions (epub reader for computer), then authorize with your Adobe ID. The left is to drag your gathered epub files to ADE, make sure you can [read ACSM via ADE](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). This is very important. 

#### Step 3: Convert EPUB to Kindle. 

Since Kindle doesn't permit us adding epub format books, why not converting epub to kindle?

This is the common way I'm speaking always. Converting epub to kindle format, then kindle can recognize them, help us to add files to read smoothly. To begin with please get the tool **Epubor Ultimate** installed on your computer.

[Windows Version Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [Mac Version Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

Then after you run it, you will see all your gathered ePub files are listed below the "ADE" icon. Just drag and drop them to the right area. If they are DRMed, this program will help you strip drm from epub with high speed. No drm? Don't worry, they are still added in this tool, waiting your next converting job.

![remove drm from epub to add](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-acsm-to-kindle-azw3.png)

<a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605" border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Select mobi or azw3 as output format. Please click on "Convert" button to get your kindle files.

#### Step 4: Transfer books to Kindle.

Conversion completed, pop-up window makes you can see your converted epub files (now they have been converted to mobi format). Now you can start to [send the converted epub files to Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

Go to witness the "miracle" moment, we can read these files without problems now!

Then the following is specific solutions to add epub to Kindle Fire, add epub to Kindle Paperwhite, and add epub to Kindle app.

### Add ePub to Kindle Fire

As Kindle Fire (or Kindle Fire HD) is a tablet device, so we can install apps. It means we can install epub reader for Kindle Fire, then add epub to epub reader.

#### Method 1: Install ePub reader apps to Kindle fire.

Though Kindle Fire is Fire OS Android, there are still some epub reading apps we can put on it. Some of them support DRMed epub books, while another only supports DRM free books. And most of ePub reader apps are Free, while some apps require you to pay. 

[Aldiko](http://www.amazon.com/Aldiko-Limited-Book-Reader/dp/B004V1XJ6Q)\--It supports DRMed books, so I like it very much, strongly recommend it to you. And it also supports pdf format. When you downloaded an ebook file, it will offer you formatting options.

[Overdrive](http://www.amazon.com/OverDrive-Media-Console-Library-Audiobooks/dp/B00850NK6I/)\--This app only supports non-drm epub books. And if pay for the pro, it will support DRMed ones. I like this app because it is possible to download library ebooks to Kindle Fire directly. With this app we can also read audio books on Kindle Fire.

[FBReader](http://www.amazon.com/Geometer-Plus-FBReader/dp/B006ZDAZ6K/)\--It is free to download, and supports DRM free epub books as well as FB2, Mobi.

[Moon+Reader](http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Reader/dp/B00F88U4J6/)\--Supports DRM free epub books. What's more, EPUB 3 multimedia content also supports (video and audio).

[Dropbox](http://www.amazon.com/Dropbox-Inc/dp/B006LR0XLM/)\--It helps us sync our gathered files between computer and android devices. Just with our dropbox account. So firstly you'd better install dropbox on your computer, then add your gathered epub files to dropbox. Next time when you run dropbox on your Kindle Fire, you can view your epub books directly.

You can download these apps from Amazon Appstore, or go to file explorer to official site, then download the app to your Kindle directly. After the app installed, you can download epub to Kindle, or add them to the reader app.

**Note:** If you downloaded epub reader not from amazon appstore but their official site, firstly you should prepare your Kindle: "Setting"- "More"- "Device"- "Allow installation of Applications from Unknown Sources".

#### Method 2: Convert epub to Kindle format with common way.

For details go back to [the first part](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) please. After you converted epub books to kindle mobi format, please connect your Kindle Fire to computer, then copy mobi books from the output folder to Kindle "Books" or "Documents" folder. Books added, from the menu you will find them.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Add ePub to Kindle App

With iPad or Android tablet, we can install Kindle free reading app to read books. But Kindle app only allows us to read books from Amazon store.

For those epub books on iPad or Android, of course there are some good reading apps we can use. For example, iBooks, Play Books, Kobo, and so on. But maybe you have fallen in love with Kindle, and you want to read those epub books by Kindle app. But I have mentioned many times at my content that Kindle only supports books from amazon, not epub or pdf format.

So in this case, firstly you must convert epub to kindle format. [The common way](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) is also useful at this part.

Then, please make sure that you also have installed Kindle for PC/ Mac app on your computer which is used to sync your converted mobi books with your reading devices.

After you installed and run the Kindle app on computer, please drag your files (from decrypted output folder of ultimate converter tool) to this app. All your drm free mobi files will be added to Kindle App.

![add epub to kindle app](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/add-epub-to-kindle-app.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Then the left job is just to run your Kindle app on your iPad or Android with your own amazon account. You will see those synced books are displayed in the library. Click the cover to open epub in Kindle.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Now I have shared all about this subject "add epub to kindle". In summary, if you want to read epub on Kindle Fire, you have alternative method, with epub reader apps. But if you want to read epub files on Kindle Paperwhite or with Kindle app, you can only choose the common way. Remove drm and convert to Kindle format, then transfer them to your device.
