## Top City Getaways for Travelers - Experience the Charm of Lisbon, Prague, and Vienna
 Planning for the start of the school year is much harder than when it was back when all students needed was a pen and notebook. A variety of devices that make studying and campus life easier for students is only useful but also truly needed in today's classrooms and dorms.

 We have kids in school from kindergarten to college; these are our thoughts on what kids today truly need (and will actually use) in school this year.

## Foldable Bike for Convenience and Security

 Bicycles can be a great way for getting to and from school and for traveling around campus quickly but finding a place to park them can often be difficult and there's always the danger of it being damaged or even stolen while in class. Folding bikes solve both of these problems.

 Not only are foldable bikes just as functional as traditional bicycles but they're much lighter and can be folded up to be carried by hand or placed in a bag. Ideally, they're as portable as a skateboard but much more useful.

 E-bikes are making big noise this year, too. Most of them are still cost-prohibitive, however, which is why we're recommending looking at folding bike options instead.

## Noise-Canceling Headphones to Help Students Focus

 Finding a quiet place to study or finish homework can be difficult for both high school and university students. Noise-canceling headphones are a fantastic solution to this problem as they essentially make any environment a potential place for focused learning.

 Noise-canceling headphones work by creating new soundwaves that cancel out other soundwaves around you. They vary in price from around $60 to over $300 with several quality options available on both ends of the price spectrum.

 They don't need to big and bulky, by the way. Plenty of earbuds these days offer noise-canceling features, such as Samsung's Buds2 Pro.

## Recording Pen for Convenient Lecture Taping

 Recording a lecture or class presentation can be a great way to improve retention of new information however having to carry a recording device in addition to all of your other belongings between classes can be a big inconvenience.

 Recording pens, also referred to as smart pens, solve this problem by functioning as a traditional pen for writing and drawing but also featuring a built-in microphone.

## Virtual Assistant for Reminders and Research

 Virtual assistants, also called digital assistants, have quickly become a part of modern computing with smartphones, laptops, tablets, computers and even video game consoles now supporting them.

 Digital assistants can be interacted with by text or voice and can be used to look up words or phrases, convert currency, ask for directions, create reminders, and more.

 The big names are Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Google's Google Assistant. Each one is available via a variety of official apps and also as built-in tools in some operating systems. Siri, for instance, is already on iPhones and iPads while Google Assistant is standard on Android devices.

 It's worth looking at smart home devices as well, such as Amazon's Echo line of devices, to help students stay in charge of their lives or ask questions while using the smartphone for other things.

## Smartphone (for Literally Everything)

 It's pretty much impossible to be a student now without a smartphone. In addition to the convenience of being able to call family or faculty when needed, modern smartphones are packed with apps that can be used to collaborate on projects, access Word and Excel files, store data in the cloud, and research any topic imaginable.

 The best phones for kids are ones are durable and easy to use, while older students can use pretty much any phone on the market that feels comfortable for them. Don't be afraid to go with a budget phone, by the way. Many of them provide everything the average student needs (including the ability to watch movies and listen to music).

## Laptop for Studying at Home and on the Go

 A laptop computer is undeniably a necessity nowadays for students in high school and those attending universities and colleges. They make it easier for students to work on assignments at home as having one means that they won't have to wait until the family computer is free to use.

 Having their own personal laptop also allows students to study on their way to and from school, take notes during class, and develop new skills that they can put to use when they join the workforce.

 If you're not sure what kind of laptop your child needs, there are a few[things to consider before you plunk down that hard-earned cash](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-pick-the-best-laptop-for-your-needs-2377614) , including your budget but also what the student will be doing with the laptop. The good news is that there is likely an option for any budget.

## Cloud Storage for Backups and Collaboration

 Cloud-storage services automatically back up files to online servers and allow for access to the same data on multiple devices such as a laptop or smartphone. Most students likely already have a Google account for Gmail and YouTube so they can use the Google Drive cloud service that's already connected to their account.

 Microsoft also has its own cloud service called OneDrive which can be used by anyone who has an Outlook, Office, or Xbox account, while another popular option is Dropbox, which is available on pretty much every device imaginable.

 There are numerous cloud services available for students to try, many with free options, and they don't have to limit themselves to just one.

## Wireless Bluetooth Speaker for Design Projects and Downtime

 Most students won't have the budget or the space in their dorm room for a full surround sound speaker setup, but a wireless Bluetooth speaker can do a respectable job in playing audio from a computer or smartphone with solid bass and high volume levels.

 A wireless Bluetooth speaker isn't just for campus parties or gatherings, though. Students studying art and design will often require a sound system for presentations and art installations, and a small device like this is both easy to carry around and will get the job done.

 But when it's time to relax, a great little portable wireless speaker is the perfect companion for a nap in the park or a trip to the beach or woods.

 FAQ

* How much storage does a student need on a laptop?  
 Cloud-storage options like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive make built-in storage less important. But if you prefer not to use those, your needs will depend on your classes. Word-processing documents for essays and research papers won't take up much space, but some files and programs will need more. Aim for at least 500GB; you can always buy an external hard drive later to expand.
* How much is a laptop computer?  
 Laptops can be a few hundred dollars or a couple thousand, and you generally get what you pay for. You should buy the most computer you can afford, prioritizing RAM, screen size, and processing speed.
