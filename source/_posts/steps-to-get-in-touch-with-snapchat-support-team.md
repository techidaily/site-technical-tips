##  How to Email Snapchat Support 

 During the process of contacting Snapchat, you'll see self-help information. If that's not enough to help, they let you leave your phone number and email address for a support member to contact you.

[ Snapchat lets you email them from their website](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/requests/new) or the app. Here's how to submit a customer service request through the app:

 You might be able to solve the problem yourself. You can[ see if Snapchat is down for everyone](https://www.lifewire.com/is-snapchat-not-working-or-is-it-just-you-4174077) and you can easily[ reset your password](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-snapchat-password-4175036) without contacting customer support. If the app isn't working right,[ update Snapchat](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-snapchat-4028921) .

1. Tap your**profile/Bitmoji** icon in the top left corner.
2. Tap the**gear** icon in the top right corner.
3. Scroll down to the**Support** section and choose**I Need Help** .

4. Tap**Contact Us** .
5. Review the list of issues and tap the one that corresponds most with what you're experiencing. If you see another set of options appear, tap the item that makes the most sense for your situation.
6. Read the instructions that appear. This is Snapchat's attempt at having you fix the problem yourself. If you still need help, tap**YES** below the directions.  
 This might not be shown for every issue, so you might not see it, depending on what you selected in the last step. This means it's not an appropriate issue for customer service to help you with.
7. Fill out the form with your information. In most cases, you're asked for your username (if you know it), email address, phone number, and a description for customer support to read.
8. Tap**Submit** to contact Snapchat.

##  You Can Leave Feedback for Snapchat Too 

 If this is less of an issue and more of an idea or a suggestion you want to share, you can provide feedback to the company. From the list of settings in Step 3, select**I Have a Suggestion** , and then fill out the form with relevant information.

##  When Will Snapchat Support Reply? 

 Snapchat doesn't specify a timeframe for when you can expect to hear back from customer service. There's also no guarantee that you_will_ hear back. Unfortunately, all you can really do is sit tight and wait it out.

 The one exception is if you message Snapchat on X. In some cases, you could get a reply in as little as a few minutes.
