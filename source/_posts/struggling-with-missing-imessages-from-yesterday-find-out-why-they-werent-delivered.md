Many reported they saw the "not delivered" flag while trying to send texts using the chat service. The tracking site received over 13,000 reports of iMessage not working properly.

After iMessage was restored, Apple's [System Status page](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) was updated to notify of "resolved issues" for its services iMessage, Apple Messages for Business, FaceTime, and Homekit.
