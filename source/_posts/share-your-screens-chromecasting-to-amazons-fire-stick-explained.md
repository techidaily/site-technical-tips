## How to Get Apple TV+ on Chromecast With Google TV  

 Chromecast with Google TV is different from previous Chromecast devices. Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra are both designed to be used with a media source – like a phone, tablet, or computer – that sends video and audio to the Chromecast wirelessly. The Chromecast or Chromecast Ultra itself isn’t capable of streaming anything by itself and always needs to receive video or audio from another device.  
 Chromecast with Google TV is similar to other streaming devices like Fire TV, Roku, and Apple TV in that it’s capable of running apps and streaming video and audio on its own without the help of a phone or computer.  
 If you want to get Apple TV on a Chromecast with Google TV, you need to download and install the app.
10. Select the**Apps tab** on your Chromecast with Google TV.
11. Select**Search For Apps** .
12. Enter**Apple TV** .
13. Select**Install** .
14. When it finishes installing, select**Open** .
15. Apple TV will run directly on the Chromecast with Google TV.

## Why It's Hard to Watch Apple TV+ With a Chromecast
