Yesterday, [Apple announced](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-unveiled-at-its-let-loose-event-ipad-pro-air-pencil-m4-and-more/) a list of devices, including the [iPad Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fgoto%2Fbuy%5Fipad%2Fipad%5Fair&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [iPad Air](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [Apple Pencil Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX2D3AM%2FA%2Fapple-pencil-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), and more, during its "Let Loose" event. 

With new iPads officially here, now's a great time to find savings on previous models. And don't be fooled; Apple's "older" iPad models still offer great features and can be just as good of a buy, especially if you don't want to splurge on the latest and greatest. The [Apple iPad (9th Gen)](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-10-2-inch-ipad-9th-generation-with-wi-fi-64gb-space-gray%2F4901809.p%3FskuId%3D4901809&publisher%5Fslug=zdnet&article%5Fname=grab%20an%20ipad%20%289th%20gen%29%20for%20just%20%24250%20after%20apple%27s%20latest%20release&article%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zdnet.com%2Farticle%2Fgrab-an-ipad-9th-gen-for-just-250-after-apples-latest-release%2F&exclusive=1&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) continues to be a reliable tablet whether for work, entertainment, or creativity, even though it is one iteration behind the current [iPad 10th Gen](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLXMVMV%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Caf5f5032-58ce-443f-951c-86b498d2d6b2%7Cdtp&dtb=1). 

**Also**: [**This $349 iPad was secretly the best announcement during the Apple event**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-349-ipad-was-secretly-the-best-announcement-during-the-apple-event/)

The [Apple iPad (9th Generation)](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2021-Apple-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-256GB%2Fdp%2FB09G91TLNJ%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Caf5f5032-58ce-443f-951c-86b498d2d6b2%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is an excellent option for users looking for reliability and functionality. The A13 Bionic chip offers a smooth user experience for day-to-day use and multitasking. Although it's an older generation, it features a fair amount of storage, and the 10.2-inch retina display showcases vibrant colors and crisp details for any captured content, making it great for a starter iPad. More significant storage iterations, like [the 256GB configuration](https://www.zdnet.com/article/buy-an-apple-ipad-9th-generation-for-379-following-the-let-loose-event/), are also on sale at some retailers if you're looking to bump up.

If the 9th Gen is too outdated for your liking, the [iPad 10th Gen](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLXMVMV%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Caf5f5032-58ce-443f-951c-86b498d2d6b2%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is also discounted right now, down to only $349 after Apple [dropped the price by $100](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-349-ipad-was-secretly-the-best-announcement-during-the-apple-event/) following the announcement of their new iPads. This model features a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display with 64GB of storage.
