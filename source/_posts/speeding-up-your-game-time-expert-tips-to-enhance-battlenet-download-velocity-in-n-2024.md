We recommend you to try all of them, then you’ll find what’s the best for you.

**Tip** : To download game torrents, you need to use a torrent clients.

You can use the web version or the app version to download game torrents.

## IMPORTANT: Protect your privacy first

 Downloading torrents is perfectly legal, so long as the files you’re downloading aren’t protected under copyright.

**Downloading copyrighted shows, movies and music is illegal** , and can attract significant penalties. All the major studios actively track the IP addresses of the computers illegally downloading their works. They then contact the associated internet service providers (ISPs) and get them to trace that IP address back to you. In many countries, ISPs are legally obligated to tell the studios who you are. And even in countries where they’re _not_ legally obligated, many ISPs will share your details anyway, simply because it’s easier.

 If you plan to download copyrighted material,   **you should definitely use a VPN (which stands for ‘virtual private server’) so you can’t be tracked and prosecuted.** A VPN hides your IP address from prying eyes. Our favorite VPN is **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s fast and cheap, and – most importantly – it will keep your IP address hidden.
