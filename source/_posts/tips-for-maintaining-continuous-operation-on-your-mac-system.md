## Can You Get Max on Your Apple TV?

 If you have a 4th-generation Apple TV or an Apple TV 4K (or later) that runs tvOS 13 or later (learn more about[tvOS versions)](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tvos-4690282) , you can download the HBO Max app from the App Store.

 streaming device.

 Not sure which one you have? Consult[Apple’s support page to identify your Apple TV model](https://support.apple.com/en-us/101605) .
