## Investigating AOL Mail Problems: How to Tell If It's a General Downtvein or Personal Internet Concern
 If you can't check AOL Mail, AOL might be down, or there could be a problem with your own connection to the internet. Sometimes it's hard to tell which it is: Is AOL Mail down for everyone, or just for you? Thankfully, with just a few quick checks, you can figure out which it is.

## How to Tell if AOL Email Is Down

 If AOL Mail is down for everyone, there's not much to be done except to wait until service is restored. Here are the most common ways to check to see if the service is down:

1. Check[Downdetector's AOL page](https://downdetector.com/status/aol/) . This site monitors many sites and services for network status and is a good place to start. It will tell you if the site is having problems or is running normally.

2. If you're still not sure, you can check other sites like[IsItDownRightNow](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/aol.com.html) or[Outage.Report](https://outage.report/aol) .
3. You can also look at the[AOL Mail Team's X (formerly Twitter) feed](https://twitter.com/aolmail) . The Mail team keeps this feed current with information about outages and issues with service. Alternatively, the[#aolmaildown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/aolmaildown) hashtag might also provide some information if you're experiencing issues.

 If you have trouble connecting to any of these sites, or no one else has identified any issues with AOL Mail, it's likely that the problem is with your own connection.

## What to Do When AOL Email Is Not Working

 If AOL Mail appears to be working for everyone but you, here are some things you can do to troubleshoot and resolve your issue:

1. If you're using a web browser, make sure you're going to the right location and didn't mistype the URL: You should be trying to visit[http://mail.aol.com](http://mail.aol.com) .
2. If you're using a mobile app, be sure you're using the official[AOL Mail app for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aol-news-email-weather-video/id646100661) or[AOL Mail app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aol.mobile.aolapp&hl=en%5FUS) .
3. If you can't get to AOL Mail via a[web browser](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-browser-446234) , the site might be down but the service itself is still working, so try using the mobile app on your phone instead, if possible. You can also try the reverse: If you can't get there using the app, try in a browser.
4. If you can't get to AOL Mail in your usual browser, try to log in using a different browser (such as[Chrome](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-chrome-4687647) instead of Firefox, for example) or log in using your browser's[private or incognito mode](https://www.lifewire.com/incognito-mode-google-chrome-4103635) .
5. If you can't get to mail using your mobile app, close the app completely and then restart the app and try again. Be sure you are not just putting the app to sleep, but are actually[closing the Android app](https://www.lifewire.com/close-apps-on-android-4164116) or [closing the iPhone app](https://www.lifewire.com/quit-apps-on-iphone-2000287) .
6. If you're using a browser,[clear the cache](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-cache-2617980) .
7. [Clear your browser's cookies](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-cookies-2617981) .
8. [Check your computer for malware](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) .
9. If none of these options worked, then you probably have an issue with the internet. Contact your[ISP](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924) 's technical support for additional help.

## Common AOL Mail Error Messages

 In addition to standard [HTTP status code errors](https://www.lifewire.com/http-status-code-errors-4165131) like[404 Not Found](https://www.lifewire.com/404-not-found-error-explained-2622936) ,[500 Internal Server Error](https://www.lifewire.com/500-internal-server-error-explained-2622938) , [403 Forbidden](https://www.lifewire.com/403-forbidden-error-explained-2617989) , AOL might sometimes display other error messages that explain why you can't connect. Here are the most common ones you may encounter:

* **The site is down for maintenance** . You may also see a variation of this message that says your account is unavailable.
* **Blerk ERROR 1**  is an error you might see if you try to access AOL Mail using an older or outdated browser.
* **GAH! ERROR 1111**  is an error that can generally be fixed by changing your AOL password or clearing your browser cache.
* **GAH! ERROR 2** and**BLERK! ERROR 3** both indicate there's a mailbox connection problem. You can generally resolve this by restarting your browser, using a different browser, or clearing the browser cache.
