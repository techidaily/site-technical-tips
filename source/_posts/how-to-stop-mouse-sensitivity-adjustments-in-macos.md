##  Why Would I Want to Turn off Mouse Acceleration? 

 Mouse acceleration makes your pointer move faster, but not everyone wants that. Here's why it can be helpful to disable the feature.   

* **To be more precise when drawing** . If you sketch designs out on your Mac, mouse acceleration can make it hard to be accurate. Nothing will compare to a stylus, but lowering or disabling mouse acceleration can help.
* **To improve your gaming performance** . If you play games like Fortnite on Mac, you'll know how important it is to be accurate with your shooting. Tweaking mouse acceleration can be useful if you don't feel comfortable with the default settings.
* **To be more comfortable** . We're all used to different keyboards and mice. If you've just switched to a Mac, you may feel more in control once you've adjusted the mouse acceleration settings.
* **To have more control** . Disabling mouse acceleration means that the mouse pointer moves the same distance as the mouse on your mousepad, which can feel more logical to some people.

 FAQ

* How do you right-click on a Mac mouse?  
 You can right-click on a Mac Magic Mouse or trackpad in two different ways. The easiest is to click with two fingers, but you can also hold**Control** while you click for the same effect.

* How do I connect a mouse to a Mac?  
 You can use either a wired or wireless mouse with your Mac. For a wired mouse, plug it in to a USB port on the computer. For a wireless, put it into pairing mode, and then go to**System Settings** \>**Mouse** and select it when your Mac detects it.
