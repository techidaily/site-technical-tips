 Spotify makes it easy to track songs you enjoy, as the Like feature lets you automatically add songs to a folder. However, you may find yourself wanting to curate your Liked Songs playlist once it’s filled with hundreds or thousands of songs.

 Removing one song at a time can be tedious, but this article will teach you an easy way to unlike all songs on Spotify so you can clear your Liked Songs list. 

##  Is There a Way to Unlike All Songs on Spotify? 

 You can't unlike all songs simultaneously in the Spotify app, but the Windows and Mac desktop apps let you delete all liked songs at once.

 Here’s how to mass delete all songs on Spotify’s desktop apps:

 The process of deleting liked songs is nearly identical on Windows and Mac. The screenshots below correspond to the Spotify app for Mac, but Windows-specific commands are noted where appropriate. 

1. Open the Spotify desktop app on your Mac or Windows computer.
2. Click the**Liked Songs** tab from the menu on the left.

 Unfortunately, you can’t select and delete your entire Liked Songs playlist on the[ Spotify Web Player](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-listen-to-spotify-using-a-web-browser-2438312) (browser app). However, you can use**Command+Click** to delete batches of songs.

##  How Do You Delete All Liked Songs on Spotify on Mobile? 

 While it’s possible to delete all of your liked songs on Spotify’s iOS and Android apps, it’s a tedious process. Neither app offers a batch delete option, which means you’ll have to tap each song individually to remove it.

 Follow the steps below to remove liked Spotify songs on mobile:  

 The process for unliking songs is identical on Spotify’s Android and iOS apps. However, the screenshots below were taken on an Android.

1. Open the Spotify app and tap**Your Library** in the bottom-right corner.
2. Tap**Liked Songs** .
