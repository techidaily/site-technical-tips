## Top Recommended Samsung Smart TV Applications - Enhance Your Viewing Experience

Hundreds of Samsung apps for Samsung Smart TVs are available, but which are the best must-have apps?

 You get the obvious streaming video apps with Netflix, Vudu, Amazon, and Hulu included on Smart TVs, but there are many other TV apps out there. You might be surprised at what you'll discover among the many apps available. Some apps are quite helpful, such as news, weather, education, and other information, and game apps can be fun.

 Here's a list that will help you decide which ones you want to try.

* View online web shows and podcasts.
* Upload your own movies, music, photos, and more.

 You don't need a cable or satellite subscription to get HBO. With a subscription to Max, you can enjoy all of the popular programs and movies offered by HBO on your Samsung Smart TV via the Internet. Here is your chance if you haven't seen_Game of Thrones_ or_Our Flag Means Death_ .
