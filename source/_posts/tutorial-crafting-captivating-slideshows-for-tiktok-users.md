##  Why Create a Slideshow and Not a Traditional Video

 I get it. TikTok is primarily made for videos, but there’s a purpose behind creating slideshows. Maybe you want to tell a story using multiple photos in a slideshow. You can have each photo describe a part of the full story with its own caption. This is a cool idea to tell your story.

 Or maybe you sell products, and you want to display each product on its own slide in a slideshow. This way you can describe each product’s details in its own slide. If the audience wants to see more products, they can swipe.

##  Create a Swipe Photo Slideshow on TikTok

 TikTok's photo slideshows work pretty much the same as the regular videos. You choose the photos to include in your slideshow, add your favorite music, apply stickers and any other effects, and publish. It's that easy.

 To start, launch [the TikTok app on your iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok/id835599320) or [Android phone](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU201721/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically) and tap the "+" (plus) sign in the bottom bar.

 On the open page, tap "Upload" as you'll add photos from your smartphone.

Close 

 On the following screen, at the top, select "Photos" so you only see pictures and not other content in the list. Then, [find the pictures on your iPhone](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-your-virtual-adventure-with-kinemaster-tips-and-competitor-analysis/) or Android phone that you'd like to add to your slideshow.

 To add a photo to your selection, in the photo's top-right corner, tap the circle icon. Do this for all the photos you want to add to your slideshow. Note that TikTok will remember the order you choose your photos in, and it will add them in the same order to your slideshow. When you've made your selection, in the app's bottom bar, tap "Next (X)" (where "X" is the number of selected photos).

Close 

 TikTok will turn your photos into a swipe slideshow. To change the music for this slideshow, tap the music icon at the top and choose your favorite track. Similarly, to add other items like stickers and filters to your slideshow, use the various editing options available on the right pane of the app. Then, in your screen's bottom-right corner, tap "Next."

 You'll land on the "Post" page. Here, add a description for your slideshow, tag the people if you want, change your post's privacy settings, and configure other options. To then publish your slideshow, in the app's bottom bar, tap "Post."

 And that's it. Your custom slideshow is now live in your TikTok profile. Your followers can see this slideshow, like it, and even comment on it.

##  Tips When You Make a TikTok Slideshow

 Creating a slideshow on TikTok is easy, and there are a few things you can do to make your slides more interesting and useful. Here are a few ways to do that:

* **Add High-Quality Photos**: When making a slideshow, make sure to pick the best-quality photos. People don’t like to see blurry images, and when you use high-quality pictures, your slideshow stands out.
* **Add Text to Your Photos**: Each photo tells a story, so tell your audience what each slide depicts by adding text to your slideshow.
* **Use Filters**: Filters help add a theme to your slideshow. For example, if your slideshow is of nature, add a relevant filter.
* **Add Relevant Music**: By using relevant music, you let your audience feel your slideshow and not just watch it.
* **Use Stickers**: Stickers make your slideshows more attractive and even help highlight certain parts in your photos. There are several stickers as well as emojis you can choose from to add to your slideshow.

##  Have Issues Creating Slideshows? Here Are Some Troubleshooting Tips

 If you’ve run into a problem while making a TikTok slideshow, the following basic fixes will help resolve the problem:

* **If You Don’t See the Slideshow Option**: This is likely the case because your TikTok app is outdated. [Update TikTok on your iPhone or Android phone](https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/mended-printer-network-error/), and you’ll see the option to make slideshows.
* **Photos Failing to Upload**: Ensure your internet connection is working, as an inactive or unstable connection can cause your photos not to upload. Toggle [airplane mode](https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-cutting-edge-audio-tools-for-iphone-and-ipad-enthusiasts/) on and off to see if that fixes the problem. [Restarting the router](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-chuckle-centric-ringtone-websites-guide/) is another fix you can use.
* **Music Not Playing**: Make sure [you haven’t muted your iPhone](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastery-techniques-for-embedding-social-media-live-videos/) or Android phone. Try picking another music track and see if it plays. The earlier track might have copyright issues in your region.
* **Other Issues**: If you have other problems, reach out to [TikTok’s support team](https://support.tiktok.com/en).

 And that's how you make an appealing slideshow comprising your favorite photos on TikTok. With various editing tools and advice at your disposal, you can bring creating slideshows on this app to the next level. Enjoy!
