## Simplify Your macOS Navigation with a Powerful, Cost-Free Application!

### Key Takeaways

* Your macOS menu bar can get cluttered with icons.
* The free Hidden Bar app hides unused icons, simplifying your menu bar and making it easier to navigate.
* Keep your Mac tidy and distraction free by removing visual clutter so you can focus on what's important.

 MacOS is a generally well-thought-out, intuitive, and user-friendly operating system, but the user interface falls short in one place: the menu bar. Here's how to wrangle all of your menu bar icons using the free Hidden Bar app.

##  Is Your macOS Menu Bar Getting Crowded?

 Just to be clear, we're talking about the menu bar in the top-right of the screen, where the battery meter, clock and icons for running background apps are found. By default, it's pretty sparse and well-organized.

 However, it can quickly get out of control as there's no built-in way to hide icons you don't often use. The Mac App Store is packed with great apps and useful menu bar tools (I like [Tim](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tim-time-tracker/id1449619230?mt=12 "https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tim-time-tracker/id1449619230?mt=12") for time tracking and [One Thing](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/one-thing/id1604176982?mt=12 "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/one-thing/id1604176982?mt=12") for remembering something important), but if you want to use more than a few, the menu bar gets crowded, making it hard to pick out the icon you're looking for.

 This is compounded if the app you're using has more than a few drop-down menus, the clutter can become distracting and make your Mac hard to navigate.

##  Hidden Bar to the Rescue

[Hidden Bar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066?mt=12 "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066?mt=12") is a free (that is, completely free, without in-app purchases) app that solves this. All you have to do is install it, and it hides all of your lesser-used menu bar icons behind a little arrow, like this:

 My macOS menu bar, now showing only the icons I use.

 Click on the arrow, and your hidden icons appear. Simple, elegant, neat and tidy. To set an icon to always be displayed, [move it by holding the "Command" key](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/n-2024-effortless-entrepreneurship-top-10-easy-to-create-biz-channels-on-youtotube/) and drag the icon to the right of the arrow. To hide the icon, drag it to the left side.
