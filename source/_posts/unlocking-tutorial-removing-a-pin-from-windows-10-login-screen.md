### What to Know

* Be sure you've signed in to the account you want to remove the PIN from before you begin.
* Go to**Start** \>**Settings** \>**Accounts** \>**Sign-in options** \>**Windows Hello PIN** \>**Remove** \>**Remove** .
* Once the PIN is gone, consider protecting your account by other means, like a password.

 This article covers how to remove a PIN in Windows 10\. PINs are an optional way to sign in, much like a password, alongside other options like fingerprint and face authentication.

 If you have kids, roommates, or a work device, it's usually best to keep a lock on your user account, but if it's just you at home, how you sign in likely doesn't matter. So, if convenience is a priority, you can go without a password and not be at risk.
