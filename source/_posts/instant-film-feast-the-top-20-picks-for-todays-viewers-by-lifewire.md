## Best Free Internet Faxing Applications - Find the Top Picks
 Faxing may seem outdated, but many organizations still conduct business via fax. There's no need to invest in a fax machine or computer fax modem, however. Free online fax services allow you to send faxes from your computer and receive them in your email.

 The free fax offerings from these services may have limited features. Read carefully before choosing one.
