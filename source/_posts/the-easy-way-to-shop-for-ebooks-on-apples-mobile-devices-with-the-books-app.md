 The Books app must be installed on your iPhone or iPad to buy e-books.[Download the Apple Books app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-books/id364709193) if you don't already have it.

 Similar to App Store and subscriptions on your iPhone or iPad, Books purchases use your iCloud payment method. You can[view details and make updates](https://www.lifewire.com/change-itunes-account-details-2000448) from Settings.

## How to Read Your E-Books

 If you purchased a book or[downloaded](https://www.lifewire.com/uploading-and-downloading-online-3985950) a free e-book, the information screen for the book changes to show a Read button. Tap**Read** to start reading the book.

 Another way to read a book is to go to the Library. Every book you add to the Books app is stored there—including books you ordered from the Books app, transferred to your device from other apps, or copied to your iPad or iPhone.

 Once you're in the Library, select the book you want to read. It opens immediately. Swipe left and right to turn the pages or tap once to access the menu.
