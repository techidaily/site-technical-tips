## How to Get Copilot for Microsoft Teams  

 Before you learn how to set up and use Copilot in Teams, it’s worth remembering that you can only use the feature if you meet the correct requirements. In the sections below, we’ll cover exactly what you need to use Copilot in Microsoft Teams.

### A Microsoft Business or Enterprise Subscription  

 To use Copilot for Microsoft Teams, you’ll need two separate subscriptions. First, you’ll need a Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, or Premium account. Unfortunately, it’s not enough to have a Microsoft 365 Personal account.  
 The good news is that you can get a free trial for Microsoft 365 Business Standard if you only want to try Copilot for Teams. After that, pricing for each three subscriptions is as follows:  
| **Microsoft 365 Business Basic** | **Microsoft 365 Business Standard** | **Microsoft 365 Business Premium** |  
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |  
| $6 per user, per month           | $12.50 per user, per month          | $22 per user, per month            |  
 You can also use Copilot for Teams with some Microsoft Enterprise accounts, but your subscription must also include Teams. So, if you haven't already, you'll have to upgrade.

### A Microsoft Copilot Subscription  

 After signing up for a Microsoft 365 Business account, you’ll also need to get Copilot as an add-on. Your IT admin (or you, if you are that person) should see a message that says:  
 “Copilot for Microsoft 365 is available to order now”.  
![A screenshot saying that Copilot is available for Teams i your subscription](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2D727oZ39tGGmRBUsHg2VwKc-ic=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/CopilotforMicrosoftTeamsAvailable-614ff945b07246c192fa1c9b7266d2a9.jpeg)  
 Once you’ve entered your personal information and payment details, you should then be able to use Copilot in Teams. If you don’t see this message, you can[buy Copilot on the Microsoft website](https://microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/copilot-for-microsoft-365) .

 When you find one you want, select**Add** to install it.

8. Your extensions will appear in your chat, and you can access them from there. For example, if you use Trello, you can view your assigned cards without needing to go to the app.  
You may need to sign in to an app to use its extension.
