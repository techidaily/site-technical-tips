## Why Use Gmail Two-Factor Authentication?

 Your email account contains a lot of valuable information. It's likely the account you use for everything, from your online banking to your social media accounts and potentially work-related tasks.

 Keeping all that information in one place is useful for you, but possibly dangerous, too. If a hacker finds your password, they can gain access to a lot of important information and wreck your online and offline identity.

 Two-factor authentication adds a layer of security by necessitating more than just your password for account access. By demanding an additional item, such as your phone, during login, it effectively prevents access, even if someone knows your password.

## How Gmail Two-Factor Authentication Works

 Depending on the 2FA method you chose during setup, Google will send you a code unique to your account. This might come via a text message to the number on file, a code in the Google Authenticator app, or a prompt on another device where you're already signed in. Each code is only usable once and expires within minutes, so it's very secure.
