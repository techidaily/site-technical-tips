VitalSource Bookshelf is very popular among students, especially college students. Many colleges and universities are associated with their eTextbooks to VitalSource Bookshelf. Students have to use the VitalSource Bookshelf program to access their eBooks for their courses. Although students can read their course materials via VitalSource Bookshelf, most of them still want to print the VitalSource eBooks for a better reading experience. Today, I will show you how to **print the VitalSource eBooks**. One is printing the VitalSource eBooks with the default method, and the other one is **downloading the VitalSource Bookshelf to PDF** for printing.

### Default Method to Print VitalSource eBooks

VitalSource Bookshelf allows users to print the eBooks but it has print page limitations so you can only print a few pages one time. Let's see how we can print a VitalSource eBooks with the page limitations. 

**Step 1:** [Download VitalSource Bookshelf](https://support.vitalsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/201344733-Bookshelf-Download-Options)desktop application and install it on your computer. 

**Step 2:** Click the Book cover and navigate to the first page of the book which you want to print.

**Step 3:** Click on _File_ at the menu and select _Print_ from the drop-down list.

**Step 4:** The print preview page will pop up. In this page, you can see that the printing for this title is restricted to 30 pages at a time. This is much more than my expectation. I even see that there is one page at a time. 

![print page limitations](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/print-restriction.png)

Choose the range for your print and click on _Continue_ button to print this book. Now you can print 30 pages at a time, but if you want to print this whole book, you need to repeat this whole process which is really annoying and time-consuming if your book contains thousands of pages. That's why I strongly recommend you use the following method to print VitalSource eBooks.

In the article it says "you can see that the printing for this title is restricted to 30 pages at a time. This is much more than my expectation."  
 Really? You don't expect to print more than 30 pages? I expect to print the entire book but this is the only way to print a 500 page book. 30 Pages at a time. Really?
