## Modifying Another Person’s Login Credentials in Windows Systems Easily
### What to Know

* Windows 11, 10 & 8: Go to**Control Panel** \>**User Accounts** \>**User Accounts** \>**Manage another account** .
* Select the user, choose**Change the password** , then enter a new password in the boxes.
* Select**Change password** to immediately change the user's password.

 There are plenty of[ways to find lost Windows passwords](https://www.lifewire.com/ways-to-find-lost-windows-passwords-2626122) , but an easy method, assuming there are multiple user accounts on the computer, is to change the user's password from within another account. These steps to change a user's password work in Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, and Vista.

## How to Change a User's Password in Windows

 The directions vary slightly between the various versions of Windows, but we call out those differences below.  

 Your Windows account must be configured as an administrator before you change another user's password. You can[change the administrator](https://www.lifewire.com/change-administrator-windows-11-6828078) if you need to.

1. [Open Control Panel](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-control-panel-2625782) . On touch interfaces, the easiest method is through its link on the Start menu (or _Apps_ screen in Windows 8), but the**control** command or[Power User Menu](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-power-user-menu-2625968) (Windows 8) is probably faster if you have a keyboard or mouse.  
 You can also use Control Panel to[change your own password](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-change-my-password-in-windows-2626070) .
2. What you select for this step depends on your version of Windows:  
   * Windows 11/10/Vista: Select**User Accounts** .  
   * Windows 8/7: Select**User Accounts and Family Safety** .  
![User Accounts in Control Panel](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kScWdVnVy4BL3mOdDwmGWwMTD9o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_how-do-i-change-another-users-password-in-windows-2626068-5bee16afc9e77c005179bbfa.jpg)  
 If the _View by_ setting is on _Large icons_ or _Small icons_ , then you won't see this link. Choose**User Accounts** instead and skip to Step 4.
3. Select**User Accounts** .  
![User Accounts in User Accounts window](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6FdhkR-aWacIDufdDFsXDK1xjBo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002_how-do-i-change-another-users-password-in-windows-2626068-5bee16ca46e0fb0026ec9506.jpg)
4. Choose**Manage another account** .  
![Manage another account link in User Accounts](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VZpHRHet2yUBIM9AyA0btX4mvTo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_how-do-i-change-another-users-password-in-windows-2626068-5bee16e846e0fb0026a436d4.jpg)
5. Select the user you want to change the password for.  
![Local Account, Password Protected in Manage Accounts window](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-_z7tjlCMeeM0FO17Z3iAeGrU8o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004_how-do-i-change-another-users-password-in-windows-2626068-5bee170ac9e77c0026ab4f2d.jpg)  
 If you don't see _Password protected_ listed somewhere under the username, then that user doesn't have a password set up and should be able to log in without entering anything in the password field.
6. Choose**Change the password** .  
![Change the password link in Change an Account window](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8RWWwC5pCPw9rbsaKxx_68Z4L8Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/005_how-do-i-change-another-users-password-in-windows-2626068-5bee174546e0fb00514f9634.jpg)  
 Don't see a _Change the password_ link? This probably means that the user you want to change the password for logs into Windows with a Microsoft account, not a typical local account. It's even easier to[reset a Microsoft account password](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-your-microsoft-account-password-2624953) .
7. Enter a new password for the user in both the first and second text boxes.  
 When you change a Windows password from outside the account, the user you're changing the password for will lose all access to EFS-encrypted files, personal certificates, and any stored passwords like those for network resources and website passwords. However, most users don't have EFS-encrypted files and the loss of stored passwords probably isn't a big deal.
8. In the last text box, you're asked to type a password hint. This step is not required.  
 Since you're probably changing this person's password for them because they've forgotten it, it's fine if you want to skip the hint. After the person regains access to their account, have them[change their Windows password](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-change-my-password-in-windows-2626070) to something more private and set up a hint.
9. Select**Change password** to save the password change.  
![Change password button in Change Password window](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6Yal22VL0GJgGF8JjNqh6_sid8E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/006_how-do-i-change-another-users-password-in-windows-2626068-5bee179dc9e77c00510d3835.jpg)

 Once signed on, be proactive and have the user[create a Windows password reset disk](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-create-a-windows-password-reset-disk-2626082) or switch to a Microsoft account, either of which will provide an easier way to get a new password in the future.
