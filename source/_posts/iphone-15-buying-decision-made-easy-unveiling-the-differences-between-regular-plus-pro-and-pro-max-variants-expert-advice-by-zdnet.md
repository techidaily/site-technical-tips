An Apple AR/VR headset -- rumored for more than six years -- finally became available this year. Eight months after Apple announced the Vision Pro at [WWDC 2023](https://www.zdnet.com/video/apple-wwdc-2023-every-product-revealed-vision-pro-15-inch-macbook-air-more/), the headset began [shipping](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-vision-pro-shipping-times-tell-us-about-the-demand-for-apples-xr-headset/) to customers. 

The highly anticipated headset was designed to take mixed-reality experiences to the next level. Apple has even claimed the Vision Pro is the "most advanced personal electronic device ever".

**Review:** [**Apple Vision Pro: Fascinating, flawed, and needs to fix 5 things**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-vision-pro-review/?ftag=TRE-03-10aaa6b&utm%5Femail=8850ada83866fe2b042041f6277c004e9a68ab834781629d69b19700d29270fc&utm%5Fcampaign%5Fid=9079333&utm%5Femail%5Fid=b34faa57a90996e0022de8d6c16f2c69c20f8d362fcf0e3750a9d0edd0939119&utm%5Fnewsletter%5Fid=92303&medium=email&source=iterable)

[Preorders for the device](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-vision-pro-in-stores-february-2-pre-orders-start-january-19/) began on January 19, and -- despite its steep price point (it starts at $3,499) -- Apple sold 200,000 units in the first 10 days, according to [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/apple-vision-pro-headset-sales/). The devices began shipping to customers in February and ZDNET secured two units for testing. 

Now that we've had over four months of testing the headset, we have the answer to your burning question -- is the [Vision Pro worth the price](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-buying-advice/)? Here is everything you need to know about the company's newest product, including specs, functionality, and some insights  editors' [hands-on experiences](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-buying-advice/).

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Apple Vision Pro The Apple Vision Pro gives users a solid glimpse into the future of the AR/VR space with must-see features such as spatial video, spatial photos, and immersive environments.

## How does the Vision Pro look and feel?

The Vision Pro's design differs from many existing AR/VR headsets. For example, the device has an external battery pack that resembles the size of an iPhone and connects to the headset via a cable. 

When using the Vision Pro, you must be mindful of the battery (you can put it in your pocket) and the dangling cable.

**Also:** [**I've tried Vision Pro and other top XR headsets and here's the one most people should buy**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-buying-advice/)

Apple has reduced the headset's weight by using a tethered battery system. Apple claims this setup solves one of the biggest issues with AR/VR headsets: discomfort after extended use. 

Despite the headset's reduced weight on the user's face, ZDNET's Jason Hiner [shared in his review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-vision-pro-review/) that he found the device uncomfortable after wearing it for over an hour or two. 

The Vision Pro itself resembles ski goggles. Its curved front includes an external screen for EyeSight, a feature that allows your eyes to be seen when others approach you.

The device features two OLED displays totaling 23 million pixels, Apple's [M2 chip](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-apple-m2-chip/), 12 cameras, five sensors, six microphones, and Siri. The headset also features Apple's new R1 chip, which runs in parallel with the M2 chip to reduce lag.

The headset has two individually amplified drivers inside each audio pad to power its Personalized Spatial Audio, which personalizes sound for a user based on their head and geometry.

To switch between AR and VR, the headset has a crown similar to the one on the Apple Watch. There is also a knob that lets users customize the fit and a button on top of the headset to take photos.

June Wan/ZDNET

Users can control the headset with eye and hand tracking, a feature that's slowly being adopted by other headsets on the market, as well as voice commands. For example, users can pinch to select and flick to scroll.

Vision Pro runs on a new Apple operating system, VisionOS, which resembles the iPadOS interface, bringing Apple's apps and services ecosystem to the headset. VisionOS was created specifically for spatial computing.

## Is the Apple Vision Pro AR or VR?

The Apple Vision Pro is a mixed-reality headset that combines augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). This capability means that, when wearing the headset, you can either completely immerse yourself in the virtual reality environment or use the headset to add an augmented reality layer to your environment.

## What can you do with the Vision Pro headset?

The headset can run popular Apple apps, including Books, Camera, Contacts, FaceTime, Mail, Maps, Messages, Music, Notes, Photos, Safari, and more in mixed reality -- a blend of both AR and VR. The headset launched with [600 new apps](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-vision-pro-will-launch-with-600-new-apps-built-just-for-the-headset/), including [Zoom](https://www.zdnet.com/article/zoom-is-coming-to-the-vision-pro-headset-and-your-meetings-could-get-weird/), [Microsoft 365](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-vision-pro-to-get-word-excel-and-other-microsoft-365-apps-at-launch/), Slack, Todoist, and more.

According to Apple, the apps feel like they exist in your natural space and environment. As a result, moving apps is similar to moving actual items around you. In his hands-on write-up, ZDNET's Jason Hiner shared that moving objects became second nature by the end of his 30-minute demo.

"Within five to 10 minutes, I was rapidly opening and closing apps, scrolling up and down and right to left, selecting things, and moving apps and windows around in the space in front of me," Hiner said. "By the end of the demo, I was doing all of this without giving it much thought and with a lot of accuracy and confidence."

Immersive video is a big selling point of the device, allowing users to feel as if they are physically present in the space where the video takes place. For example, with the headset, you can stream a movie and watch it as if it were playing on a giant screen in another environment, such as the beach, with immersive spatial audio. 

June Wan/ZDNET

The Vision Pro is also compatible with existing third-party streaming services to maintain the continuity between your favorite apps and the headset. For example, users can access [Disney+](https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/159047/564546/9358?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F%3Firclickid%3D1eCWQ9VJuxyPU99WF9394wTLUkH3c-3NW3lLW80%26irgwc%3D1%26cid%3DDSS-Affiliate-Impact-Content-CNET%2BMedia%2BInc.-564546%26tgclid%3D0e010035-05fe-461e-b800-06bf65e631d8%26dclid%3DCI%5F8-PC724QDFYO20QQd5PEKvA&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), ESPN, [Amazon Prime Video](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fvideo%2Foffers%2Fintercept%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cc02206c7-548b-4df2-8a02-f5c96273ec0f%7Cdtp&dtb=1), [Paramount+](https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/159047/175360/3065?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&subid2=cbscidmt=thechi), [Peacock](https://imp.i305175.net/c/159047/828265/11640?&utm%5Fcampaign=20200101evergreen&cid=20200101evergreenpdaffil001&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), IMAX, and MUBI, to name a few. 

ZDNET Reviews Editor Kerry Wan found the [immersive sport-watching experience](https://www.zdnet.com/article/watching-apples-mls-playoffs-immersive-video-on-the-vision-pro-was-my-aha-moment/) to be one of the biggest pros of the headset and described the experience as "real, spirited, and stimulating". 

"Forget the productivity tools, games, and creepy Personas. The Apple Vision Pro's killer app revolves around our favorite pastime: watching sports," Wan said. 

**Also: [Watching Apple's MLS playoffs Immersive Video on the Vision Pro was my 'aha' moment](https://www.zdnet.com/article/watching-apples-mls-playoffs-immersive-video-on-the-vision-pro-was-my-aha-moment/)**

You can also use spatial video to watch videos shot on your iPhone. This experience is one of the headset's biggest standout features, according to Hiner. 

"The difference between regular photos and videos and spatial photos and videos is almost like the leap from black-and-white to color in photographs and film -- although this may be an even bigger jump," Hiner [shared](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-buying-advice/). 

If you're interested in using the headset for work purposes, you're in luck. The headset can double as a 4K external monitor by mirroring what's on your connected Mac onto the AR interface. (The feature only supports a single Mac display, but Apple might one day expand support to multiple displays.)

In addition, FaceTime for Vision Pro allows for videoconferencing, which you can use to work with your co-workers on projects simultaneously. The tiles of people on the call are "life-sized" and each person's audio comes from the individual's tile position, allowing for more natural conversations.

People on the call see the [Vision Pro wearer's "digital persona"](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-your-digital-persona-apples-vision-pro-users-to-get-real-time-animated-avatars/), which uses machine-learning algorithms to reflect the wearer's face and hand movements in real-time, according to Apple. You can watch a video of [Hiner and Wan FaceTiming each other](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/v6Ve0r8GxdM) with their digital personas.

The headset can create a persona for you by scanning your face and building a realistic, depth-filled model that moves during FaceTime calls.

## How much does the Vision Pro cost?

The Vision Pro has a hefty price tag of $3,499 for the 256GB base storage model, setting a premium category apart from [Meta](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meta-quest-3-unveiled-price-features-and-when-you-can-buy-metas-new-vr-headset/), [HTC](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meetings-in-the-metaverse-our-experience-with-htc-vive-sync/), and other manufacturers that play in the sub-$1,000 range. 

**Also: [7 hidden costs of the Apple Vision Pro to factor into your XR budget](https://www.zdnet.com/article/7-hidden-costs-of-the-apple-vision-pro-to-factor-into-your-xr-budget/)**

Apple also offers two additional storage options: the 512GB configuration, which retails at $3,699, and the 1TB, which retails at $3,899\. The box itself includes the headset, the battery pack, a Dual Loop Band, a cover, a light seal cushion, a polishing cloth, a USB-C Power Adapter, and a USB‑C Charge Cable. 

**Also:** [**Don't buy an Apple Vision Pro headset without this crucial accessory**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dont-buy-an-apple-vision-pro-headset-without-this-crucial-accessory-applecare-coverage/)

In addition to the storage modifications, eyeglass wearers also have to factor in the cost of the Zeiss Optical Inserts, which range between $99 to $149\. 

There are other bells and whistles you can opt for, such as Apple Care+ for $499 for two years or $25 per month, or accessories, such as the $199 Travel Case.

## What comes in the Apple Vision Pro box?

Included in the $3,499 purchase price is the headset, the battery pack, a Dual Loop Band, a cover, a light seal cushion, a polishing cloth, a USB-C Power Adapter, and a USB‑C Charge Cable. You [can watch Hiner unbox the device here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mEaUtquyqZ4).

## Can I wear the Apple Vision Pro with glasses?

You should not wear the Apple Vision Pro with glasses on your face. The headset was not made to accommodate glasses. Wearing both simultaneously could result in an uncomfortable experience that could damage your headset. 

**Also:** [**How much does it cost Apple to make a Vision Pro headset?**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-much-does-it-cost-apple-to-make-a-vision-pro-headset/)

However, Apple knows that people who wear glasses need to be able to see to use the headset, so the company also sells Zeiss Optical Inserts. They retail at $99 to $149, so if you are a glasses wearer considering buying the headset, make sure to factor in this additional cost.

## Does the Apple Vision Pro have controllers?

One of the standout features of the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apples-vision-pro-price-features-hands-on-insights-and-everything-you-need-to-know/) is its advanced hand tracking, which allows users to forgo using controllers for a more immersive AR/VR experience. Unlike the Meta Quest 3, there is no optional controller. Instead, you rely entirely on hand tracking.

**Also: [Vision Pro controller could resemble an Apple Pencil, patent suggests](https://www.zdnet.com/article/vision-pro-controller-could-resemble-an-apple-pencil-patent-suggests/)**

However, if you want controllers in the future, you may be in luck. Apple recently applied for a [patent](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20240069352) for Handheld Controllers with Charging and Storage Systems. One perk of controllers is that they offer much more precision, which is especially useful for working professionals such as engineers. Before you get your hopes up, it is worth noting companies file many patents every year, and only some of the tech ever sees the light of day.

## When is the Vision Pro available?

The Apple Vision Pro is available for purchase on the Apple website and in stores. Preorders for the device began on January 19, and those units began arriving on February 2\.

## Can you try the Vision Pro before buying it?

Yes, you can try the Vision Pro before purchasing by booking a one-on-one demo experience with a specialist at an Apple Store. You can find the booking link on [Apple's website](https://www.apple.com/retail/instore-shopping-session/session-selection/?topic=visionpro). You can also purchase the Vision Pro, try it for yourself, and return it after two weeks.

## What Apple Vision Pro updates were announced at WWDC 2024?

At WWDC 2024, a year after the Apple Vision Pro headset was unveiled, the company updated [VisionOS 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-visionos-2-features-unveiled-at-wwdc-2024-what-im-excited-about-and-puzzled-by/), adding many features to the headset. 

There were many announcements, but some of the highlights included:

* A feature that lets users transform any 2D photo into a spatial photo
* New hand-motion gestures, for example, users can open their hands and tap to reach the home screen or turn their wrists to see the battery level
* A new ultrawide monitor view equal to two 4K monitors side by side
* Train support for travel mode
* A guest user option that allows additional users to save their eye and hand data for 30 days

If you want to see the full list, you can read the VisionOS 2 section of this article: [Every new feature Apple unveiled for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and more this fall (including AI)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-new-feature-apple-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-mac-and-more-this-fall-including-ai/).

## Is Apple Vision Pro better than Meta Quest 3?

The Apple Vision Pro is more of a premium headset and, as a result, it costs seven times more than the $500 Meta Quest 3\. 

**Review:** [**Meta Quest 3: The VR headset most people should buy in 2024**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meta-quest-3-review/)

The products differ in display, weight, processors, controllers, and more, affecting their use cases and biggest benefits. To break down which headset is best for you, check out [Kerry Wan's comparison article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meta-quest-3-vs-apple-vision-pro/).

## Is the Apple Vision Pro worth the price?

This is the three-and-a-half-thousand-dollar question. Ultimately, whether the Apple Vision Pro is a good fit for you depends on your use cases, interests, and needs. To help you make that decision, ZDNET's Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner wrote two helpful articles:

* [Pre-ordering Apple Vision Pro? These 5 questions can help you decide](https://www.zdnet.com/article/pre-ordering-apple-vision-pro-these-5-questions-can-help-you-decide/).

After spending time with the Apple Vision Pro, Hiner shared his [full review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tried-apple-vision-pro-for-a-weekend-and-here-are-my-3-biggest-takeaways/), including his overall rating, experience, and whether he would recommend it.
