Buy Apple's second-generation AirPods now at a major discount at Amazon.

Apple's classic second-generation AirPods were already ZDNET's tested pick for [best AirPods for the price](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-airpods/). You can often find them discounted to $99 at major retailers, like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart, but rarely do they go past that price point.

Lucky for us, that already-affordable price dropped once more, and the deal is still available -- you can snag a pair of AirPods for just $89 from [Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cc897cc8f-f17e-41e6-8410-d72f180f8ed4%7Cdtp&dtb=1) right now, saving you $40 off the original price. If you've been thinking about getting yourself a new pair ahead of the Fourth of July, now might just be the time to buy.

[Apple AirPods (2nd Gen): Save $40 $89 at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cc897cc8f-f17e-41e6-8410-d72f180f8ed4%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

The second-generation AirPods come with a Lightning charger case. They offer solid sound, five hours of battery of life (and a fully-charged case can recharge them five times, giving you up to 24 hours), and voice-activated Siri access. They're also super easy to set up and to switch between your Apple devices.
