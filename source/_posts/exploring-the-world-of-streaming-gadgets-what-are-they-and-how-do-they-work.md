## Exploring the World of Streaming Gadgets: What Are They and How Do They Work?

Close 

 A streaming device is a valuable way of expanding your options for watching content, giving you more options and apps. Some content requires a subscription to a service such as Netflix or Amazon Prime, but you can also use streaming devices to view content from your smartphone, such as photos or videos you have taken.

##  What Device Is Used for Streaming? 

 There are numerous different devices available for streaming. The most popular devices are:

* Apple TV
* Amazon Fire TV Stick range
* Roku Streaming Stick range
* Chromecast

 It's also possible to use game consoles including the Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 to stream content via your TV.   

 There's no one perfect streaming device out there. Each device has its own benefits and drawbacks; some work better with specific streaming services but most will work with all services.

##  How Do Streaming Devices Work? 

 A streaming device is a small computer dedicated to streaming content through your TV. It connects to the TV via an HDMI cable and uses your internet connection via ethernet or Wi-Fi.   

 Explicitly designed with streaming in mind, their operating systems are limited to offering apps relevant to their purpose. Apps include Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and other popular streaming services. A remote, app, or voice control helps you negotiate the menus.

##  Do You Need a Streaming Device if You Have a Smart TV? 

 A smart TV offers similar functionality to a streaming device, but a dedicated solution can work better, especially if your smart TV is aging. Here's a look at why.   

* **A streaming device can be faster.** Depending on your smart TV, a streaming device can often be faster and more responsive than using your TV. So if you're impatient, this is a good solution.
* **More options** . Some TVs don't get updates as frequently as streaming devices, which offer more options and functionality.
* **Voice control support** . Some smart TVs offer voice control support, but it probably doesn't if your TV is older. A streaming device typically provides voice control support which can be helpful for those with mobility issues.
* **A streaming device can be simpler to use** . TV operating systems can often be quite cluttered to browse. A streaming device is designed with one purpose, making it easier to navigate.
* **Portability** . A streaming device isn't dependent on one TV. So if you travel often, you can take it with you to use elsewhere.

 If you have a smart TV and can stream the content you want without any trouble, there is no reason to buy a streaming device.
