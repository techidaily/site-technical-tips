## July's Recommended Selection of Top Gratis Hard Disk Assessment Utilities
 There are several free programs available to help you test your hard drive and identify any issues. Here are my top recommendations that I've been suggesting to people for years.

 Most apps have similar features, but some only work on specific hard drives. No matter which software you use, you may need to[replace your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) if it fails some part of one of these tests.  

 Your Windows PC includes tools like Windows Error Checking and the[chkdsk command](https://www.lifewire.com/chkdsk-command-2625838) . Still, others, like those below, are available from hard drive manufacturers and other developers.

EmEditor is a fast, lightweight, yet extensible, easy-to-use text editor, code editor, CSV editor, and large file viewer for Windows. Both native 64-bit and 32-bit builds are available, and moreover, the 64-bit includes separate builds for SSE2 (128-bit), AVX-2 (256-bit), and AVX-512 (512-bit) instruction sets. New versions support AI-assisted writing.</a>

 What We Like

* Works from both inside and outside of Windows
* Completely free
* SeaTools for DOS works on any operating system
* Windows tool lets you test a hard drive from any manufacturer

 What We Don't Like

* SeaTools for DOS can be hard to use and install
* DOS version can deal with only 100 errors before restarting
* DOS edition might not work well with RAID controllers

[My Review of Seagate SeaTools](https://www.lifewire.com/seagate-seatools-review-2626150)

 Seagate SeaTools is free hard drive testing software that comes in two forms for home users:

* **SeaTools Bootable** and**SeaTools for DOS** support Seagate or Maxtor drives and run independently of your operating system on their own[USB](https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039) drive or CD, respectively.
* **SeaTools for Windows** installs on your Windows system. Use it to perform basic and advanced testing of any kind of drive—internal or external—from any manufacturer.

 Seagate's programs are excellent. They are used to test hard drives by professional computer services but are easy enough for anyone to use.

 The Windows version should work with Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP. There's also a Linux version.

[Download SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/#downloads)

 For those looking for SeaTools Desktop, SeaTools Online, or Maxtor's PowerMax software, please note that the tools above have replaced all three. Seagate now owns the Maxtor brand.

## [HDDScan](https://www.lifewire.com/hddscan-review-2624562)

![HDDScan v4.0 in Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/G9fOWcvomg4Ly8WDhxdfhVlAuZk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/hddscan-5a5d1babc7822d003762cc05.PNG)

 What We Like

* Works with all hard drives
* No installation need (portable)
* Easy to use
* Includes a SMART test
* Runs on all modern versions of Windows

 What We Don't Like

* Runs on Windows only
* No built-in help docs or tips for using it
* Can't install the program to your computer (it runs as a portable program automatically)

[My Review of HDDScan](https://www.lifewire.com/hddscan-review-2624562)

 HDDScan is a free hard drive testing program for all types of drives, no matter the manufacturer. It includes a[SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.) test and a surface test.

 Some reasons I chose this app are because it's easy to use, is completely portable, supports almost all drive interfaces, and seems to be regularly updated.

 The official system requirements state that you need to be running at least Windows XP, so it should work with Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, and Vista, including Windows Server 2003.

## [GSmartControl](https://gsmartcontrol.shaduri.dev/downloads)

 What We Like

* Choose from three different tests
* Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
* Lets you view the drive's SMART attributes
* A portable version is available

 What We Don't Like

* Doesn't support every USB and RAID device
* When exporting information, it includes_everything_ , not just a specific result you want to save

 GSmartControl can run various hard drive tests with detailed results and give an overall health assessment of a drive.

 View and save SMART attribute values like the power cycle count, multi-zone error rate, calibration retry count, and many others.

 GSmartControl runs three self-tests to find drive faults:**Short Self-test** takes around 2 minutes to complete and is used to detect a completely damaged hard drive,**Extended Self-test** takes 70 minutes to finish and examines the entire surface of a hard drive to find faults, and**Conveyance Self-test** is a 5-minute test that's supposed to find damages that occurred during the transporting of a drive.

 This program can be downloaded for Windows as a portable program or as a regular program with a normal installer. The latest version works with Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, and Vista, but there's an outdated edition you can get for older Windows versions. It's also available for Linux and Mac operating systems, as well as included in a couple of LiveCD/LiveUSB programs.

 What We Like

* Tests hard drives regardless of the OS that's installed
* Not too difficult to use
* Lets you erase data from the drive, too

 What We Don't Like

* Tests Samsung HDDs only
* Isn't as easy to install as a desktop-based program
* Must have access to a working computer to set up the program
* Text interface (no buttons you can click)
* Hasn't been updated in many years

[My Review of Samsung HUTIL](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-hutil-review-2624563)

 Samsung HUTIL is a free hard drive diagnostic utility for Samsung hard drives. HUTIL is sometimes called ES-Tool.

 This tool is available as an[ISO](https://www.lifewire.com/iso-file-2625923) image for burning to a CD or USB drive. This feature makes HUTIL operating system independent and a better testing tool, in general, than those designed for use within Windows. It's also possible to run HUTIL from a[bootable](https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-booting-mean-2625799) floppy disk.

 Because this is a bootable program, you'll need a working hard drive and OS to burn it to a disc or USB device.

[Download Samsung HUTIL](https://files.hddguru.com/index.php?directory=Software/Samsung/HUTIL)

 HUTIL will_only_ test Samsung hard drives. It will load and find your non-Samsung drive but you will not be able to run any diagnostics on the drive.

 Western Digital Dashboard for Windows.

 What We Like

* Runs from within Windows
* Really easy to use
* Also shows basic information about the drives

 What We Don't Like

* Scans Western Digital hard drives only

[My Review of Western Digital Dashboard](https://www.lifewire.com/western-digital-data-lifeguard-diagnostic-review-2624564)

 Western Digital Dashboard is free hard drive testing software for Windows that lets you run several hard drive tests.

 It supports viewing Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) information. There's a Short Test option that performs a relatively fast self-scan, and an Extended Test that checks the whole hard drive for bad sectors.

 This tool can also be used to wipe a hard drive using the Write Zero[data sanitization method](https://www.lifewire.com/data-sanitization-methods-2626133) .

 What We Like

* Keeps track of SMART attributes to predict hard drive failure
* Can be configured to email you when certain events take place
* Well-organized and easy-to-use interface
* Small download size

 What We Don't Like

* Doesn't scan SCSI or hardware RAIDs
* Free for home/personal use only, not commercial/business

 DiskCheckup should work with most hard drives. SMART info like reading error rate, spin-up time, seek error rate, and temperature is displayed, as well as short and extended disk tests.

 Details in the SMART section can be configured to send an email or display a notification when their attributes exceed the manufacturer's recommended threshold.

 DiskCheckup should work fine with Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP, plus Windows Server 2008 and 2003.

[My Review of HD Tune](https://www.lifewire.com/hd-tune-review-2624561)

 HD Tune is a Windows-based hard driver tester that works with any internal or [external hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-external-drive-2625867) , SSD, or memory card.

 You can run a[benchmark](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-benchmark-2625811) read test with HD Tune, check the health status with Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology, and run an error scan.

 Only Windows 7, Vista, XP, and 2000 are said to be the only supported operating systems, but I used HD Tune in Windows 10 and Windows 8 without any issues.

* One of the easiest hard drive testing apps to use
* Provides two hard drive testing functions
* Runs from within Windows, but there's also a floppy version if you don't have Windows

 What We Don't Like

* Tests Fujitsu hard drives only
* The bootable program runs from a floppy disk only (not a disc or flash drive)
* The floppy program isn't as easy to install and use as the Windows version
* The desktop program runs on Windows only

[My Review of Fujitsu Diagnostic Tool](https://www.lifewire.com/fujitsu-diagnostic-tool-review-2624559)

 Fujitsu Diagnostic Tool is a free hard drive testing tool designed for Fujitsu hard drives. It's available in both a Windows version and an OS-independent, bootable DOS version. However, the bootable version is designed for floppy disks—an image that works with a CD or USB drive is not available.

 Two tests are available: A "Quick Test" (about three minutes) and a "Comprehensive Test" (time will vary based on hard drive size).

 The Windows version is said to work with Windows 8, 7, Vista, and XP. It might also run just fine in Windows 11 and Windows 10.

**Download For** :

[Windows](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/fujitsu%5Fwindows%5Fdiagnostic%5Ftool.html)

[DOS](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/fujitsu%5Fdiagnostic%5F%28ide%29.html)

 Fujitsu Diagnostic Tool will perform hard drive tests on Fujitsu drives_only_ . If you have any other make of hard drive, try one of the manufacturer independent tests listed toward the beginning of this list.

 What We Like

* Scan results can be emailed to you automatically
* Runs a surface scan to check for errors
* Shows SMART attributes
* Checks errors on both internal and external hard drives
* Scan results show useful information

 What We Don't Like

* Hasn't been updated in a long time (the last official supported OS is Windows 7)
* Works on Windows computers only
* Doesn't include as many features as most other hard drive testers

[My Review of Free EASIS Drive Check](https://www.lifewire.com/free-easis-drive-check-review-2624558)

 Free EASIS Drive Check is a hard drive tester that incorporates two main testing utilities—a [sector](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-sector-2626003) test and a SMART value reader.

 The SMART test lists more than 40 values about a hard drive, while the sector test checks the surface of the media for reading errors.

 The report of either test can be read straight from the program when complete, configured to be sent to you by email, or printed off.

 Free EASIS Drive Check is said to work with Windows 2000 through Windows 7, but I successfully tested it in Windows 10 and 8 as well.

 Ariolic Disk Scanner is similar to Macrorit Disk Scanner in that it's just a read-only scan of a drive to check for bad sectors. It has a minimal interface with only one button and is easy to understand if any parts of the drive contain bad sectors.

 One thing that's different from Macrorit Disk Scanner is that Ariolic Disk Scanner lists the files where read errors occurred.

 I tested Ariolic Disk Scanner in Windows 11, 10, and XP, but it should also work with other versions of Windows. The program is portable and just over 1 MB in size.
