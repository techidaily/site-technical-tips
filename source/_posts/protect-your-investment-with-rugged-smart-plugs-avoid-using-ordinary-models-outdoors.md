## Protect Your Investment with Rugged Smart Plugs: Avoid Using Ordinary Models Outdoors

Why limit your smart home to just the indoors? Kasa's [Outdoor Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVMXZMDM?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004863&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-use-any-smart-plug-outside%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) can help you control your outdoor appliances for under $20.

[Smart plugs](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/2-ways-to-monitor-huawei-nova-y71-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) are a great way to add some basic smart home functionality to items you can't or don't want to replace with a smart version. That can also go for appliances that are outside.

 But you need to be careful. Even if you live in a relatively temperate area, it's never a good idea to put a piece of tech meant for the indoors outside. A thunderstorm or even a mishap with a hose can ruin your smart plugâ€”and if that's the only thing ruined, consider yourself lucky.

 Thankfully, there are outdoor smart plugs with water and dust resistance so you can extend your smart home beyond the walls of your house. Outdoor tech tends to be more expensive as a trade-off for the proper weather resistance and peace of mind, but when it comes to the Kasa Smart Plug, the price is nearly identical to other normal smart plugs you'll find on the market.

 Normally $25 for a two-socket plug, you can pick up one on sale for $18\. That's only $4 more expensive than the [Kasa Smart Plug 2-Pack](https://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-HS103P2-Required-Google-Assistant/dp/B07B8W2KHZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004863&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-use-any-smart-plug-outside%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), on sale for $14\. For the extra money, you get a plug that is [IP64 weather-resistant](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) and capable of everything you'd want from a smart plug, including scheduling and voice control. Why risk putting an indoor smart plug outdoors when the savings can't even buy you a coffee?
