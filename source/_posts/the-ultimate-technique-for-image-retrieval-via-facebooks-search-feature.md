##  How to Use Facebook Image Search 

 Facebook assigns a numerical ID to all photos uploaded to the social media channel. Images downloaded from Facebook have that numerical ID as part of the file name by default. If you know this number, you can use it to find the source of the picture on Facebook.

 Using this ID number might help you locate the profile picture of the person who shared it, or the person whose profile you are trying to find might be named or tagged in the image.

1. Right-click the image you want to search for on Facebook.
2. Select**Open in New Tab** in Google Chrome.  
 If you are using a different web browser, select**View Photo** ,**View Image** , or a similar option.

3. Look for three sets of numbers separated by underscores in the address bar or file name of the image, such as those highlighted in this example.

5. Type (or copy and paste)**https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=** into your browser's address bar.
6. Paste the ID number of the image directly after the**\=** in the address bar. This example would appear as **https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10161570371170223** with no spaces.

 You can use this method to search for any image, whether it is online or saved to your own device.
7. Press**Enter** to go directly to the photo on Facebook and find the profile on which it was posted.  
 Privacy settings might prevent you from accessing the image on a Facebook page. If the photo is not public or the owner has blocked you, the photo might not be viewable.
