## Navigating the Choices: How to Pick Between iPhone and Android for You

 When you decide to buy your first smartphone, your first decision is which one to buy. The major options are iPhone and Android. While both offer many great features, iPhones and Androids are very different in several ways.

![iPhone vs Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xCOEUOq13oyuAt9L6OGq66adI28=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/iPhone-vs-Android-e8d8c3a54ed04d15863a5953a63202a0.jpg)

## Overall Findings

 iPhone

* Closed hardware and software ecosystem.
* Manufacturer: Apple.
* Built-in assistant: Siri.
* Also compatible with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.
* Fewer versions available at a time.
* Features limited to what Apple implements.

 Android

* Easy to download apps from both official and unofficial sources.
* Manufacturers: Google, Samsung, OnePlus, Motorola, and more.
* Built-in assistant: Google Assistant.
* Also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Samsung Bixby.
* Available with a variety of features and prices.

 Whatever phone you current own, it's not perfect. However, that doesn't mean that switching is automatically going to make you happier. Before you make the switch, you need to take a close look at the following for each (in terms of the features important to you):

* Hardware
* Operating systems
* Available apps
* Gaming potential
* Security
* Virtual assistants
* Device integration
* Maintenance

 Depending on your specific needs, some items will be more critical than others as you decide which phone to purchase.  

## Hardware: Android Has More Options

 iPhone

* Only a few models available at a time.

 Android

* Available from a variety of manufacturers, some of whom are better than others.

 Hardware is the first place where the differences between the iPhone and Android become clear.

 Only Apple makes iPhones, so it has extremely tight control over how the[software](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-software-4153107) and hardware work together. On the other hand, Google offers Android software to many phone makers, including Samsung, HTC, and Motorola. Because of that, Android phones vary in size, weight, features, and quality.

 Premium-priced Android phones are about as good as the iPhone, but a cheaper Android device with fewer features may be all you need.

 If you're buying an iPhone, you need to pick a model. Because many companies make Android devices, you must choose a brand and a model. Some may prefer the choice, but others appreciate Apple's greater simplicity and higher quality.

## Operating Systems: Both Have Benefits

 iPhone

* Runs on Apple's iOS.
* New versions launch annually.

 Android

* Runs on Android, with some manufacturers using a slightly different version.
* Android may update less regularly.

 Android phones run on Google's[Android operating system](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-android-1616887) , while iPhones use Apple's[iOS](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ios-1994355) . In general, they work the same: You'll have a home screen with your most popular apps, including games and utilities, a phone app to make calls, a camera app for pictures, and a messaging app to send texts. They also use touch interfaces, including hardware like accelerometers or gyroscopes, for more functions.

 Apple releases a new version of iOS about every fall, with additional updates throughout the year. In the earlier days of Android, updates were less frequent and regular (Android 2.0 came out in 2009, while both 3 and 4 came out in 2011). Recently, however, Android has fallen more into an annual update cycle. Some Android device makers, like Samsung,[use a slightly modified](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-samsung-one-ui-4178405) operating system version.

 Some Android makers are slow to update their phones to the latest[version of the Android OS](https://www.lifewire.com/android-versions-4173277) and sometimes don't update their phones. Apple typically supports phones for five or six years old, Samsung supports phones for around four years, and Google supports the latest Pixels for seven years.

New versions support AI-assisted writing.</a>

## Apps: Android Has More Options

 iPhone

* Only available through Apple's App Store (others are supported in the EU).
* Around 2 million apps.

 Android

* Available in the Google Play Store and through third-party sources.
* Around 3 million apps.

 The Apple App Store offers fewer apps than Google Play, but we're still talking_millions_ of apps, and the selection isn't the most crucial factor.

 Apple is strict about what apps it allows, while Google's standards for Android are more relaxed. Apple's tighter control is part of why its app store has fewer offerings than Google's, which means you're less likely to download malware.

 The other benefit of Apple's centralized storefront is that the company is sure that everything in there is compatible with the available devices. The combination of multiple manufacturers of Android phones and less screening in the Google Play Store means that you may not be sure that an app you want will work with your particular phone.

 That aside, the higher selection and ability to download Android apps outside the official Google Play Store may appeal to some users.

## Price: iPhones Are Generally More Expensive; Androids Have a Wider Range of Affordability

 iPhone

* General range: $500 - $1,500+

 Android

* General range: $100 - $1,700+

 Apple positioned the iPhone as a premium device, and the price reflects that. You won't find a new one for less than $500\. Meanwhile, Android-compatible phones are available at a huge range of prices, from around $100 to 20 times that amount.

 While it's possible to get an Android phone for cheaper, you may get what you pay for. High-end Samsung devices can cost as much or even more than an iPhone if you want a new Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel. At this end of the range, there's little difference in quality between Android and iPhone. A cheaper Android may be fine if you don't need a high-tech camera or other features.  

 However, the wide availability of payment plans from Apple, Google, and retailers means you can quickly get an upper-tier phone by paying monthly instead of all at once. These options make price less of an issue.

## Security: Apple Keeps It Locked Down

 iPhone

* Encrypted end-to-end.
* App Store designed to prevent malware.

 Android

* Encrypted end-to-end.
* Wider third-party app availability can open a device to malware.

 If you care about the security of your smartphone, the[iPhone is more secure than the Android](https://www.lifewire.com/reasons-iphone-is-more-secure-than-android-2000308) . The main reason is the operating system's design.

 Apple controls downloads. One of the most common ways to compromise digital security is by downloading malware â€“ software designed to steal information or affect how a device works.

 Apple works to prevent malware from appearing on its App Store, which is the primary way to get iPhone apps and the_only_ way if you're not in the EU. In this way, Android's openness and flexibility can become a liability.

 However, it's important to note that the iPhone isn't immune to security threats; it's less likely to be targeted than Android-based phones.  

## Intelligent Assistant: Google Assistant Beats Siri

 iPhone

* Default platform: Siri.
* iPhones can use Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa through apps.

 Android

* Default platforms: Google Assistant or Samsung Bixby.
* Android users can't use Siri.

 Artificial intelligence and voice interfaces will drive the next frontier of smartphone functionality. Android has a clear lead here.

[Google Assistant](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911) , the most prominent intelligent assistaAssistantroid, is very powerful. It uses everything Google knows about you and the world to make life easier. For instance, if your Google Calendar knows that you're meeting someone at 5:30 and that traffic is terrible, the AssistaAssistanttify you to leave early.

[Siri](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-siri-help-1994303) is Apple's answer to Google Assistant for artificial intelligence. It's improving with each new iOS release. That said, it's still limited to relatively simple tasks and doesn't offer the advanced smarts of Google Assistant.

 iPhone users who don't like Siri can also use Google Assistant, while Android owners can't access Siri without an Apple product.

## Ecosystem: Apple's Is Closed but Powerful

 iPhone

* Seamless interaction with Macs, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and other devices.

 Android

* Less interactivity between Android devices, especially from different manufacturers.

 Many people use a tablet, computer, or wearable in addition to their smartphone. For them, Apple offers a better integrated experience. Because Apple makes computers, tablets, watches, and the iPhone, it provides features that Android may not.

 For example, you can use your iPhone as a remote for your Apple TV. You can also unlock your iPhone or MacBook with an Apple Watch. AirDrop lets you instantly transfer files and links between an iPhone, Mac, or iPad without creating an email.

 Other continuity features let you start a YouTube video on Apple TV and pick it up where you left off on the iPhone. AirPlay can let you share your Mac's screen with an Apple TV or use an iPad as a second monitor.

 Google's services, like Gmail, Maps, etc., work across all Android devices. But unless your watch, tablet, phone, and computer are all made by the same companyâ€”and there aren't too many companies other than Samsung that make products in all of those categoriesâ€”Android has no unified cross-device experience.  

## Serviceability: Get Android for DIY Fixes

 iPhone

* Self-repair is difficult, if not impossible.
* You'll need to take your device to a service provider or Apple Store.

 Android

* Many manufacturers make their devices user-serviceable.

 Apple emphasizes elegance and simplicity in the iPhone above all else. That's a significant reason that users can't[upgrade the iPhone's storage](https://www.lifewire.com/can-you-upgrade-iphone-memory-1999878) or replace the batteries (replacement iPhone batteries are possible, but they have to be installed by a trained repair person).

 On the other hand, Android manufacturers often let users change the phone's battery and expand its storage capacity.

 The trade-off is that Android is a bit more complex and less elegant, but that may be worth it compared to running out of storage or avoiding paying for an expensive battery replacement.

## Final Verdict

 Both iPhone and Android provide solutions for people with different needs. If you already own Apple products like the Mac, iPad, or Apple TV, getting an iPhone is an easy choice. If flexibility or apps are essential, go for an Android.

 Different categories matter more for certain people. Some will value hardware choice more, while others will care more about battery life or mobile gaming. Both platforms offer good options for different people. You'll need to decide what factors are most important and choose the phone that best meets your needs.
