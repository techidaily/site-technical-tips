<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Method 6: Replace the batteries

 The wireless mouse relies on AA alkaline batteries for power. If the batteries are having problems, your Logitech wireless mouse won’t have enough power to perform.

 You can**remove and insert the batteries** again to see if the problem persists. If the problem persists, you can replace the batteries with new pair. Also check if the spring in the battery compartiment is fixed. Try to remove the batteries, then move the spring a little bit, and place the battery back.

If this method doesn’t fix the problem, go to Method 7.

---

## Method 7: Try using the mouse on a different surface

 Electrical items and metal items may interfere with the signal of the mouse. Keep the mouse and the receiver away from the electrical items such as cordless or cellular telephones or other wireless mouse devices or receivers. Do not put the mouse or the receiver on metal surfaces or objects, especially long metal rails or cables.

If this method doesn’t work for you, go to Method 8.

---

## Method 8: Try the mouse on a different computer

 Try the mouse on a different computer. This will help determine if the mouse is dead.

 If the mouse works on another computer, the device is working properly. If the device doesn’t work on another computer, you can consider replacing the mouse with a new one.
