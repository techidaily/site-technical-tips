## How to Get Verified on X 

 While X continues to verify accounts, getting verified on X has become a mysterious process now that X no longer accepts verification requests.

 According to X, verified accounts are accounts that are of public interest. In other words, the only way to get a blue checkmark is to become a person of public interest. There's no formula for that, so unless you're a celebrity, a popular influencer, or you have an agent who knows someone with decision-making power at X, your chances of getting verified are slim.

##  What It Means to Have a Verified X Account 

 Verified X accounts can be identified by the blue checkmark badge beside the user's name. When you see the blue checkmark, it means that the person, brand, or organization behind the account is legitimate, and X has verified the identity.

 Verified badges on X accounts help followers distinguish the real accounts from the imposters (for example, fan accounts and[ parody X accounts](https://www.lifewire.com/twitter-parody-account-ideas-3486084) ). Verification is only necessary for high-profile individuals, well-known brands, and large organizations. Since many people know who or what they are, there's a higher risk of seeing imposter accounts built around them.

 Some users try to trick followers into believing that their account is verified. These users place a blue checkmark in other places, such as their profile photo, header photo, or bio. If you see this on any account, don't fall for it.

 A real verified X account has the official blue checkmark badge at the end of the full name, regardless of whether it's displayed on their profile, in a retweet, in search results, or anywhere else.

##  Why X Stop Accepting Public Submissions for Account Verification 

 In addition to representing authenticity, having a blue checkmark badge beside a name on X brings a degree of authority and importance to that account. In other words, it's perceived as an endorsement.

 By giving verified users visual distinction, X strengthened the perception of the blue checkmark badge being an endorsement. When X decided to accept public submissions for verified accounts, the perception weakened as accounts that didn't deserve endorsement statuses were granted verification. Users couldn't understand why some accounts got verified while others didn't.

 To evaluate the verification process, X announced that it was halting applications for account verification in November of 2017\. If you submitted a request before November 2017, it's unlikely at this point that X is going through those last few submissions and has decided not to grant your request.

##  What to Do if You Can't Get Verified on X 

 Instead of focusing on getting your account verified, focus on optimizing your profile photo, header photo, bio, website, and, most importantly, your tweets.

 As you build a following and your influence continues to grow, protect your account by enabling two-step login verification. Other social networks have introduced verification features, so get your other social accounts verified while you wait around for X.

##  What to Do if You Get Verified on X 

 According to the X[ verified account FAQs](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/twitter-verified-accounts) , recently verified accounts are automatically required to provide personal information (such as a phone number and email address) for a password reset.

 X also recommends that all verified accounts be cautious with connecting third-party apps. X recommends reviewing them regularly and revoking access to ones that look unfamiliar or aren't being used.

 X has the right to remove verification at any time without notifying the account holder. Besides the risk of losing verification for inappropriate behavior, an account could also lose its verification status for changing profile settings that alter the account's original purpose.

 If an account loses its verification status, X might decide that it's not eligible to be restored.
