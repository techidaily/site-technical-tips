If you buy books from Amazon store, the books will be downloaded to your Kindle automatically, you needn't to know its format, its saving folder, just tap on the book then you can read it.

But for a book not bought from Amazon store, how can you transfer it to Kindle / Kindle Fire and read it?

Before transferring a book to Kindle, you need to make sure it's Mobi format. Why Mobi? It's accepted by all generation of Kindle eReader and Kindle Fire tablet.

This article will only cover how to transfer Mobi files with USB cable, if you want to transfer other Kindle books, like AZW3, PRC, and use alternative methods other than USB, you can learn more [Kindle transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) methods in this article. 

### Transfer Mobi Books to Kindle eReader

By talking about Kindle eReader, I mean E-Ink Kindle, including Kindle 2 (I doubt if anyone is still using this one), Kindle DX, Kindle Keyboard, Kindle 5-Way Controller, Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 1/2, and Kindle Voyage.

No matter which generation you are using, the steps are the same.

1\. Make sure the book is Mobi format.

2\. Plug Kindle to computer with USB cable.

3\. Copy the Mobi file and paste it to "documents" folder, which is under Kindle's root path.

Frequently Asked Qustions:  
 Q: Why the book doesn't show up in my Kindle after being transferred?  
 A: It takes time for Kindle to react, and it depends on the storage usage situation and Kindle generation.  
 Q: Why there is no cover in home screen?  
 A: This is how Kindle works. Amazon only wants Kindle to display paid Amazon books in Kindle home screen. (By manually uploading a thumbnail image to Kindle you can fix this)

### Transfer Mobi Files to Kindle Fire 1/2/HD/HDX

If you are using Kindle Fire tablet, no matter which generation it is, you can follow the steps below.

1\. Make sure the book is Mobi format. 

2\. Plug Kindle to computer with USB cable. 

3\. Copy the Mobi file and paste it to "Books" folder, which is under Kindle's root path.

Notice: On a Kindle Fire tablet, you might see "Books", "Documents", sometimes even "Kindle" folders under the root path. In fact you can paste the Mobi file to any of them, but the "Books" folder is the 100% existing one, so I recommend it in the steps above.

Frequently Asked Qustions:  
 Q: Why the book doesn't show up in my Kindle after being transferred?  
 A: By default the Mobi books won't show up in "Books" tab, you can find the book in "Docs" tab. Amazon thinks a Mobi file is a document rather than a book.  
 Q: Why there is no cover in home carousel?  
 A: You need to make sure the cover image is higher than 1000PX in width. Amazon doesn't want to show a low resolution image on the home screen. \[Guide about [changing Kindle book's cover image](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)\]
