[Our Review of Google Calendar](https://www.lifewire.com/google-calendar-review-1357929)

 Google Calendar is an easy-to-use free online calendar that you can share with anyone.

 Choose who's allowed to make changes to your calendars and who can view them, or keep your Google calendars completely private. You can also invite people to single events from a completely private calendar without disclosing the other events in your calendar.

 If you already have a Gmail account, using Google Calendar is as simple as opening the link. You'll love how easy it is to access, share, update, and sync Google Calendar.

 Plus,[making events from Gmail messages](https://www.lifewire.com/create-a-google-calendar-event-from-a-message-in-gmail-1172093) is really handy. You can even[embed Google Calendar in your website or blog](https://www.lifewire.com/embed-google-calendar-website-or-blog-1616957) .

 Calendar is also part of Google Workspace, which is available to anyone with a Gmail account and offers deeper integration with other Google apps, including Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides.

## [A Nice Option For Teams and Individuals: Calendar](https://www.calendar.com/)

![Calendar web app monthly view](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZiRHXJ_iKRFsFCMwscDet3mudMw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004_free-online-calendars-1357935-ef99155780244ad997250d3ca5e28f77.jpg)

 What We Like

* Syncs Google, Outlook, and Microsoft 365.
* Add two members to workspace.
* Multiple calendar views.
* Event scheduling.

 What We Don't Like

* Some limitations with free account.
* Limited to one connected calendar at a time.

 While the paid versions of the simply named Calendar program appeal to businesses and larger teams, the free tier offers a lot of the most useful features for individuals.

 The streamlined online calendar, also available for Android and iOS, allows you to connect one calendar from either Google, Outlook, or Microsoft 365\. If you want to integrate more than one external calendar simultaneously, you'll have to upgrade.

 You can also create your own calendar within the app and invite one other member to join the workspace and collaborate, including participating in meetings—through there's a limit of five events annually. The two-seat limitation might be restrictive for some, but for a couple or two friends, this option could be ideal.

 Calendar isn't flashy, but it offers color coding, multiple calendar views (daily, weekly, and monthly), a unified view for all calendars, and a Zapier integration for all account levels, which adds another perk for free users.
