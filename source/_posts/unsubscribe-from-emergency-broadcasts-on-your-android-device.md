## AMBER and Emergency Alerts Explained

 The AMBER Alert system is a voluntary partnership between law enforcement, broadcasters, transportation agencies, and the wireless industry to inform citizens of serious child abduction cases in their area.

 Wireless emergency alerts are sent by authorized government alerting authorities through your mobile carrier. Wireless customers do not pay any connection or data fees when receiving WEA messages.

 Along with AMBER alerts, most phones feature settings for other types of notifications. Weather alerts include warnings sent for tsunamis, tornados, flash floods, hurricanes, and other extreme weather.

 Presidential alerts will only occur during a national emergency. According to FEMA, Presidential alerts cannot be disabled.
