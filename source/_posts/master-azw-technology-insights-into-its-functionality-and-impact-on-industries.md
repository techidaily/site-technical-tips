[Epubor DRM removal doesn't recognize my Kindle files](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/16/2016 11:15:13 PM 

I sync my Kindle files via Kindle app and get some "fragment files" not azw format. Epubor Kindle DRM removal cannot recognize it. Is this the new format of Kindle files? I just want to decrypt some Kindle files.

[Limits on trial version of Epubor Ultimate?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 2/5/2021 10:55:46 AM 

You offer a 30-day free trial of Epubor Ultimate. What limits are there on the use of the trial version? (I want to test conversion of up to 5 AZW3 files that are locked by DRM before comitting to purchase).

[Is it okay to convert a file to ePub that doesn't say nodrm?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/18/2016 6:51:36 PM 

Hi, I'm using the trial version of your software. I've tried to convert a Kindle book I bought, but it's acted differently from the other one I just covered to ePub. When I put it into the list of files in the Ultimate window, it doesn't tick or say "decrypted". However, if I then convert it to ePub, it works. The files appear to both still contain the Kindle serial number. Will this cause me a problem with Kindle if I then view it on my reader on my Samsung phone?

 These are the filenames: bookname\_B00WJT3D8Q.azw3 (after import), and bookname\_B00WJT3D8Q.epub (after conversion  
).

['FSDownloadContent' file?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/21/2020 7:03:33 AM 

Last few downloads from Amazon have resulted in a 'FSDownloadContent' file, instead of the usual azw3\. Epubor doesn't recognize this format - any comments?

[How do I unDRM a Kindle .azw book.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/16/2020 9:09:34 AM 

Both Kindle DRM removal and Epubor Ultimate refuse azw and azw3 books. They tell me that they do not support borrowed books but these are books that I bought for real money as I bought your software.

[Epubor Ultimate metadata issue](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 4/4/2023 9:15:56 AM 

When converting epub to mobi or even azw3 or anything else, the date in the metadata SHOULD not change as that is the published date. However, I have been having non-stop issues with Epubor Ultimate whenever I have tried to convert a book from epub to mobi or something else. It will CHANGE the date in the metadata from the original published data listed which is accurate, to the current date, which is the day I am converting the file. I don't want to have to continually go through and fix every single file so they are accurate. Can you PLEASE fix this so they are indeed accurate to the book???
