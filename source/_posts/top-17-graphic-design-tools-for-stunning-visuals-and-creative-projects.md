## [ Social Media Templates: Adobe Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/) 

![Adobe Express graphic design app.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YuN9tWgV2F5M9byqbAf14obgZ2Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-17-best-graphic-design-software-2024-01-562ebfc5ce74433b97a5f078135934cd.jpg) 

 What We Like

 What We Don't Like

* Only 25 AI credits with free access.

 Adobe Express is an all-in-one web-based graphic design app that boasts a massive range of image and video tools for all kinds of projects. Numerous templates are available that let you quickly dive in and begin producing image or video posts for social media or other online platforms. Many are meant to help you create traditional PDF files and posters.

 The UI is straightforward, with most of the main features available for free. Adobe Firefly, Adobe’s AI tool, can generate images in-app or edit existing images with text prompts, though prompts are limited to 25 credits per month for free users. Credits are required for each AI task. The $9.95 Premium monthly membership unlocks 250 credits, AI video editing tools, and stock image access.

## [ Casual Graphic Design: Canva](https://www.canva.com) 

![Canva graphic design web app.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/42zFoIG2iPners5rN_BHlnrthco=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-17-best-graphic-design-software-2024-02-0397c8d8c8414e41811b437c5ce89409.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Lots of free templates.
* AI tools for editing images and writing text.

 What We Don't Like

* The amount of features can feel overwhelming.

 Launching back in 2013 as one of the first web-based graphic design platforms,[ Canva](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-canva-4687512) has since expanded its offerings to include even more templates for a wider variety of formats, stock photos, video editing tools, and even AI-powered image editing and text writing.

 As always, Canva is a good choice for designing PDFs, business cards, and posters, but it’s also now a solid choice for creating more ambitious design projects of various sizes.

## [ Free Image Editing For Beginners: Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net) 

![Paint.NET image editing software on Windows with photo of espresso shot.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xex491QRuVk2dXeZ0DTjJRwJLww=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-17-best-graphic-design-software-2024-08-e594b0c10e7d4ecd8a7d7dbd4ca3b7c4.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Has all the basic image editing tools.
* Completely free to download and use.

 What We Don't Like

* Lacks the more high-end features from Adobe and Affinity’s apps.

 Paint.NET is a free image editing app for Windows that comes with all of the tools one would need for doing some basic photo editing or graphic creation. In Paint.NET, you can[ adjust levels](https://www.lifewire.com/better-photos-using-paint-net-levels-1702098) , install[ custom brushes](https://www.lifewire.com/use-custom-brushes-in-paint-net-1702091) , and[ use the Magic Wand](https://www.lifewire.com/magic-wand-tool-in-paint-net-1702078) to select areas. Layers, cropping, and resizing are also supported. It’s basically Adobe Photoshop from the early 2000s, but it is free and continually updated with bug fixes and improvements.

 This is not the same as the Paint program included with Windows.

 Paint.NET isn’t for everyone, though. If you’re a pro graphic designer or photographer who needs to manage large numbers of files and requires more advanced features, you’ll likely be better off with an Adobe or Affinity app. For beginner and casual use, though, Paint.NET is ideal.

## [ Biggest Memes Resource: ImgFlip](https://imgflip.com)

 What We Like

* Every tool you’ll need for your design project.
* Supported by most industries.

 What We Don't Like

* The recurring monthly subscription is a pain.

 It’s impossible to talk about graphic design apps without mentioning Adobe’s suite of products. Most design professionals have likely used at least a couple of Adobe apps, and many clients and companies require their use. The main four Adobe apps are[ Photoshop](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-photoshop-4688397) for creating and editing images, Illustrator for vector artwork, Lightroom for organizing photos, and InDesign for creating print media, though there are several niche services that many people use.

 Access to these apps is available with a monthly Adobe Creative Cloud subscription of $59.99 (frequently discounted to $35.99). However, individual apps can also be obtained with solo app-specific subscriptions ranging from $4.99 to $19.99 monthly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 What We Like

* No subscription required.
* Rivals Photoshop in functionality.

 What We Don't Like

* Not as many plugins as Photoshop.
* Lacks AI tools.

 Affinity Photo 2 is undoubtedly the best alternative to Photoshop. Affinity Photo 2 has all of the primary features found in Photoshop and can be used for any graphic design project you’d typically use. It also supports the importing and exporting of Photoshop's[ PSD file format](https://www.lifewire.com/psd-file-2622194) so there’s no issue using it when working with a client who’s a Photoshop loyalist.

 Affinity Photo 2 lacks some of Photoshop’s newer features, such as one-click object selection and AI asset generation. However, if you don’t need those tools and want to avoid an ongoing Adobe subscription, Affinity Photo 2 is a no-brainer.  

 Available on iPad, Mac, and Windows.

* Lacks support for InDesign INDD files.
* Lacks popularity at industry level.

 Affinity Publisher 2 is arguably the best software for graphic designers looking for something like Adobe InDesign that doesn’t need a monthly subscription. Publisher 2 features all of the main functions found in InDesign for creating magazines, books, and marketing materials. It also tends to load and run faster than InDesign too.

 However, unlike Affinity Photo 2, which can be used seamlessly with Photoshop, Affinity Publisher 2 doesn’t support InDesign[ INDD files](https://www.lifewire.com/indd-file-2622754) which can make collaborating with large clients who use InDesign difficult. For smaller teams and freelancers, though, Publisher 2 is worth considering.

 Available on iPad, Mac, and Windows.

## [ Best Subscription-Free Illustrator Alternative: Affinity Designer 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) 

![Affinity Designer 2 graphic design program on Windows.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zctVD0QG_wAaucIFZwRCa95mSAI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-17-best-graphic-design-software-2024-06-7a248ed3eab042568603a9c7903e9cff.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Can be bought without a subscription.
* Large number of file export options.

 What We Don't Like

* Can’t save files in the common AI format.

 Affinity Designer 2 is a solid rival to Adobe Illustrator regarding vector creation software. Designer 2 matches almost all of Illustrator’s features, is less intimidating, and requires fewer system resources.

 The main downside of Affinity Designer 2 is its inability to save projects in Adobe Illustrator's[ AI file format](https://www.lifewire.com/ai-file-4140802) which is incredibly common in the graphic design industry. Finished files can be exported as PNG and a host of other file types, though, so this is only an issue if collaborating with someone who requires AI files.  

 Available on iPad, Mac, and Windows.

 What We Like

* Over 3 million royalty-free photos.
* Lots of variety and styles to choose from.

 What We Don't Like

* Search function is hit-or-miss.

 If you’re working on a graphic design project, you’ll likely need high-quality stock photography, and it’s hard to beat Unsplash. Unsplash is completely free to use, web-based, and boasts a library of over 3 million photos taken by professional photographers. All photos are royalty-free, meaning you don’t need to pay or ask permission to use them. Various resolutions are available.
