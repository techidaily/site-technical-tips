## How to Reverse a Video Snap

 Reversing a video snap is as easy as[applying a filter](https://www.lifewire.com/apply-snapchat-filters-4157939) to it. You can do this in both the iOS and Android versions of the Snapchat app using the same steps.

1. Record a new video snap in the app by tapping and holding the**record** button. Your video must be less than 10 seconds for the reverse filter to be available.  

### Note

 You can apply the reverse filter effect only to videos that you've recorded on Snapchat. You won't be able to reverse video snaps from videos you[uploaded to Snapchat from your device](https://www.lifewire.com/upload-saved-photos-or-videos-to-snapchat-4103878) .
2. **Swipe left** on your video snap preview to browse through the filters until you see three reverse arrows (<<<) appear over your video. It applies to the reverse video filter, which will automatically play your video in reverse as a preview. Any sound in the video will also play in reverse.

### Tip

 The reverse video filter is about the eighth filter when swiping to the left. You can find the reverse filter by swiping right through filters, but that will take you longer to get to it. Some filters let you speed up your video snap (**rabbit** filter) or slow it down (**snail** filter).
3. Optionally, add more effects (text, stickers, drawings, etc.) to your video snap. Tap**Send To** to send it to friends and/or post it to your stories.

## When to Apply the Reverse Filter on Video Snaps

 Reversing your video snaps is a fun way to showcase a series of events backward. This filter is often best applied to action-packed videos.

 For example, consider something as simple as dropping a rock onto a frozen pond that breaks through the ice. Instead of watching the ice shatter at the end of the video, you could apply the reverse filter to show the fractured ice coming back together as the video footage plays backward.
