Want to show your Windows screen to your friends on chat windows like Slack? Want to share something fun on your Windows screen on Instagram or Twitter? Or want to capture your screen for error message to send to a technician…. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae002b4a8048.jpg)  Whatever the reason here’re quick ways to **screenshot on Windows** .

## Try these 3 quick ways to screenshot on Windows

2. [Screenshot your single active window](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Screenshot any part of your screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Way 1: Screenshot your full screen

 If you want to screenshot your full screen, the most recommended way is to **press the PrtSc key**  on your keyboard. The PrtSc key allows you to **capture your full screen** on all versions of Windows.  1) Let your Windows display the screen you want to screenshot.  2) On your keyboard (usually on the first right line), press the **PrtSc** key. This key  may show as **Print Screen** , **PrtScn** , **PrtScr**  varying from different keyboards.

 Tada! Your Windows screen image should now be saved to the clipboard.

**NOTE:** If you use multiple monitors, when you press the PrtSc key, all your monitor screens would be captured simultaneously in one image.

 3) Now you can paste the picture on your chat windows or on **Paint** to save it by pressing the **Ctrl** and **V** keys at the same time.  If unluckily, your print screen key stops working, you can troubleshoot it using this easy guide — [Print Screen Not Working](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
