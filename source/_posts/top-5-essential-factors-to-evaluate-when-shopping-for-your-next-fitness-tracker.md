## [Dune: Part Two (2024) - Max](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15239678/)

Warner Bros.

**IMDb Rating** : 8.6/10  

**Genre** : Adventure, Sci-Fi, Action  

**Starring** : Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson  

**Director** : Denis Villeneuve  

**Motion Picture Rating** : PG-13  

**Running Time** : 2 hours, 46 minutes  

 The second entry in Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s_Dune_ sees Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) continue his quest for vengeance against the Harkonnens by uniting the Fremen people of Arrakis.

 Villeneuve’s ambitious sequel delivers on the sci-fi epic spectacle that defined the first film, but it also devotes more time to unpacking the source material’s themes. Paul’s journey is defined just as much by thrilling knife fights and ground-shaking sandworm rides as it is by a sense that the Fremen may be trading one occupying colonial force for another.

Universal Pictures

**IMDb Rating** : 8.3/10  
**Genre** : Biography, Drama, History  
**Starring** : Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon  
**Director** : Christopher Nolan  

**Motion Picture Rating** : R  
**Running Time** : 3 hours  

 Christopher Nolan’s award-winning biopic tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who led the development of the first nuclear weapons during World War II.

 Based on Kai Bird’s biography_American Prometheus_ ,_Oppenheimer_ frames its subject as a brilliant but flawed scientific mind whose life’s work may have placed mankind on an inevitable path of self-destruction.

 Murphy’s standout lead performance anchors a film largely comprised of extended sequences of people sitting in rooms having conversations, but it’s the star-studded ensemble cast that helps push Nolan's film into the realm of instant classic.

 Over the Christmas holiday in 1970, a cranky teacher (Paul Giamatti) reluctantly remains at his New England boarding school, where he’s joined by a misunderstood troublemaker (Dominic Sessa) and head cook Mary (Joy Randolph), whose son was recently killed in the Vietnam War.

 Warm and emotional,_The Holdovers_ feels destined to become a modern holiday classic thanks to its excellent performances and pitch-perfect period aesthetic.

Paramount Pictures

**IMDb Rating** : 7.6/10  

**Genre** : Crime, Drama, History  

**Starring** : Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Lily Gladstone  

**Director** : Martin Scorsese

**Motion Picture Rating** : R  

**Running Time** : 3 hours, 26 minutes  

 Set in 1920s Oklahoma, Scorsese’s grueling epic centers on Mollie Burkhart, a member of Osage Nation, as her community suffers a series of murders driven by the discovery of oil under Osage land.

 While_Killers of the Flower Moon_ drew mixed reactions for its heavy focus on the perpetrators of the Osage Nation murders at the expense of its victims, the film’s existential horror is profound and uncompromising, with America’s appalling history of violence perpetrated against Indigenous peoples reflected in Gladstone’s Academy Award-winning performance.

**Starring** : Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe  

**Director** : Yorgos Lanthimos  

**Motion Picture Rating** : R  

**Running Time** : 2 hours, 21 minutes  

 Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a young woman brought back to life by off-kilter scientist Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe), navigates exploitation and misogyny as she learns about the world and carves out her place in it.

 Featuring a tour-de-force lead performance from Stone,_Poor Things_ is surreal gothic/steampunk/fantasy filmmaking at its finest, with a twisted satirical edge that’s hard to resist.

**IMDb Rating** : 7.6/10  

**Genre** : Biography, Drama, Sport  

**Starring** : Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, Maura Tierney  

**Director** : Sean Durkin  

**Motion Picture Rating** : R  

**Running Time** : 2 hours, 12 minutes

_The Iron Claw_ is based on the real-life story of the Von Erich brothers, who rose to prominence in the world of professional wrestling in the early 1980s.

 While Durkin’s film doesn’t delve as deeply into the tragedy of the Von Erichs as many would have liked,_The Iron Claw_ is a competent sports biopic that effectively balances depicting thrills in the ring with the exacting toll that happens outside of it.

**IMDb Rating** : 7.0/10  

**Genre** : Comedy, Crime, Romance  

**Starring** : Glen Powell, Adria Arjona, Retta  

**Director** : Richard Linklater  

**Motion Picture Rating** : R  

**Running Time** : 1 hour, 55 minutes  

 Gary Johnson (Glen Powell), a New Orleans professor who moonlights as an undercover “hitman” for the police, ends up getting a little too caught up in his fake persona when he meets Madison (Adria Arjona) and helps her flee her abusive husband.

 Writer-director Richard Linklater’s dark rom-com is another slamdunk showcase for Glen Powell, who’s quickly become one of Hollywood’s biggest leading men and a genuine crowdpleaser who somehow juggles multiple genres without veering too far off course.

 Set in German-occupied Poland in the summer of 1943,_The Zone of Interest_ focuses on SS officer and Auschwitz commander Rudolf Hoess, who lives next to the infamous camp with his wife Hedwig and their children.

 In this Academy Award-nominated film, Glazer rejects the idea of Holocaust perpetrators as “mythologically evil,” as he examines the rote, mundane lives of participants in one of the twentieth century’s greatest horrors.

 James Cameron’s long-awaited return to Pandora continues the story of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña), as they’re forced to flee their home and make contact with a Na’vi water tribe.

 Like its predecessor,_The Way of Water_ makes up for a lack of narrative ambition with its stunningly realized world. Cameron’s penchant for show-stopping third-act action set pieces is on full display, but the film is at its best when it takes a breath to luxuriate in its fictional characters’ day-to-day life and customs.

**Running Time** : 2 hours, 30 minutes  

 When Rocket (Bradley Cooper) is gravely injured, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy go on a desperate mission to save their teammate and friend by seeking out his sadistic creator.

 One of the few bright spots of the post-_Endgame_ MCU (at least so far),_Guardians 3_ is just as irreverent as its predecessors but reaches new emotional depths in its exploration of Rocket’s tragic backstory.

 After witnessing the murder of his mother as a young child, Kid (Dev Patel) works his way up an underground fight club to exact revenge against the men who destroyed his life.

 Patel’s directorial debut,_Monkey Man_ is a stylish, violent love letter to Bruce Lee and modern revenge cinema like_The Raid: Redemption_ that also shines a light on the inherent exploitation and inequalities of India’s caste system.

 In the summer of 1957, Enzo Ferrari (Adam Driver) stakes the future of his automobile company — and marriage to his wife Laura (Penélope Cruz) on the Mille Miglia, a dangerous 1,000-mile race across Italy.

_Heat_ director Michael Mann eschews the full biographic format here and instead hones in on a pivotal moment in Ferrari’s life, depicting the motorsport icon as a man whose arrogance gains him both professional glory and personal ruin.

 After a misunderstanding torpedoes their first date, Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) are reluctantly reunited at a wedding in Australia and forced to confront their true feelings for one another.

 Still on the run from the High Table, deadly assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) embarks on a globe-trotting mission that may offer a way to put down his former employer for good.

 While this fourth John Wick installment is a bit overlong and covers familiar ground, the action setpieces continue to impress, including a staircase fight that ranks among the best in the series.

 An introverted young woman’s (Kaitlyn Dever) reclusive life turns to horror when she becomes the target of an otherwordly home invasion.

 A tense thriller punctuated by a near-total lack of dialogue, Duffield’s twist on the alien invasion flick is a fun genre mashup carried by Dever’s commanding, solo lead performance.
