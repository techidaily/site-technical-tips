I know there are many people want to find an easy way to convert azw3 to epub, or conver azw3 to mobi, but from some forums, social media sites, and so on, I also glanced that a part of people desire to know how to convert azw3 to pdf.

As one of the most common ebook format, pdf also has its loyal fans, especially when you want to print, or protect your files.

So I decide to write this article today, about **how to convert azw3 to pdf**, help those people who want to read kindle eBooks on multiple devices, print kindle books, or for some more needs.

To begin with, let's talk about the feature of kindle azw3 books.

### What is AZW3

You may have heard of azw3 format, but probably you don't know it much. So at this part I will show you what is azw3 file, when will you get an azw3 file, etc.

![what is azw3 file](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/what-is-azw3.png)

AZW3 is one of Kindle ebook's formats. In other words, AZW3 belongs to Kindle, only used by Amazon Kindle store. So if you got an azw3 file, it must be owned by kindle. In common you will also see somebody called it "KF8", kindle format 8\. It's more advanced than kindle's other formats such as mobi, azw, for it supports more layouts, fonts, styles.

At the beginning azw3 is only used on Kindle Fire, but recently azw3 file is widely used on E-ink readers. You may have found that if you download one book on Kindle Paperwhite, then connect it with PC, from the kindle drive you will see this downloaded file is with .azw3 suffix.

###  Why convert azw3 to pdf

I have said that azw3 file is only supported on Kindle devices, so when we want to read those purchased azw3 books on non-kindle devices, what should we do? 

![why we convert azw3 to pdf](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/why-convert-azw3-to-pdf.jpg) Perhaps somebody will recommend you to use free kindle reading app, but, for kobo glo, sony eReader, what can we do? Those devices couldn't support installing apps. What's more, although for some tablets such as iPad, Nexus 7, we can install kindle app, but kindle app only supports kindle books, so if we want to read another books purchased from iBooks, Play Books, we have to change to use another reading app. Don't you think it's too messy?

At this time, converting azw3 to pdf or epub is your alternative, wise choice. Because nearly all of non-kindle devices support epub and pdf format. If you like epub, look at [how to convert azw3 to epub](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/); if you love pdf, or you want to print kindle books, continue to follow this post please.

### Problem before converting azw3 books

You may think we can convert azw3 books to pdf directly, but the fact is **we can't do anything unless removing Kindle DRM**!

![drm in kindle azw3](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/drm.jpg) Kindle DRM is produced by Amazon Kindle store, prevents us copying kindle books at random. But just because of this limitation, we can't dominate our files though we have paid money for them. We have no rights to copy, transfer, share our kindle files.

You love Kindle books, but you hate Kindle DRM, yes? So what do you do? Yes skipping the drm limitation.

Don't worry at the last part I will tell you how to remove kindle drm and convert azw3 to pdf just with an all-in-one tool. The best way to convert drm azw3 to pdf.

 Ive tested it with a book Ive bought on Amazon, but I need it as PDF because it was easy for me to follow some intrusctions from the book, with this program I could pass the DRM protection and had it in my computer.

Which tablet do you want to use to read the AZW3 file? The AZW3 file only can be read on Kindle for PC/mac and Kindle for android tablet.
