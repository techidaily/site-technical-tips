## DIY Tech Tips: Repairing the Most Frequent Glitches on Televisions
 At a glance, a TV seems simple. However, modern TVs are complex devices with a wide range of features and settings that can be problematic. This article will teach you how to fix a TV suffering common issues.

 This guide refers to many TV settings in general terms. Your TV may refer to these settings by a different name. We recommend you have the TV manual available for reference.

## The Causes of Common TV Problems

 A TV can malfunction or appear to malfunction for many reasons, but we can place most problems into a few categories.

* Brightness: The TV is too dark.
* Color: The TV's color is unappealing.
* Aspect ratio: The TV's image looks squashed or stretched.
* Motion: The TV's motion is too smooth or stutters.
* Hardware defect: The TV won't turn on or is physically damaged.

 You can fix the first four issues by changing TV settings. Hardware defects and physical damage, however, will require professional repair.

## How to Fix a TV With a Dark Image

 A TV with a dark image can be, at best, difficult if not impossible to watch. It may not be bright enough to see in a lit room or fail to show detail in dark content. Here's how to fix a TV with a dark image.

1. Turn off the TV's energy-saving features. Look for Energy Star, Eco, Green, or something similar. Energy-saving features limit a TV's brightness.
2. Turn off the TV's Ambient Light Sensor if it has one. An ambient light sensor will limit a TV's brightness depending on how well lit a room is.
3. Increase the TV's Brightness. Most TVs ship with a default brightness setting much lower than the maximum brightness possible.
4. Change the TV's contrast value to be at the middle of the range of settings available.  
 A contrast setting that's too high can be unattractive, so we recommend keeping value towards the middle of the range available.
5. [Change the TV's gamma setting](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-gamma-493590) . Gamma settings are often expressed as numbers. A lower number will provide a brighter image.
6. Factory reset your TV.  
 A factory reset will erase any settings you have saved to the TV.

## How to Fix a TV With Color Issues

 Most TVs offer a wide variety of color settings that significantly change how the TV looks. Adjusting these settings may fix unusual color issues and help you customize the TV to match your preferences.

1. Change the television's picture mode. Most TVs label this as**Picture Mode** or**Display Mode** .  
 Flip between modes to see if the color is more to your liking.
2. [Change the TV's color temperature](https://www.lifewire.com/tv-color-temperature-4156944) . Flip through the available settings until you find a color temperature to your liking.
3. [Change the TV's color gamut](https://www.lifewire.com/lcd-monitors-and-color-gamuts-833038) . Flip through the available gamut to find one that is to your liking.
4. Factory reset your TV.  
 A factory reset will erase any settings you have saved to the TV.

## How to Fix a TV With a Squashed or Stretched Image

 Nearly all modern TVs have a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio, and most content is made with this in mind. However, you may see squashed or stretched content when connecting devices designed for older displays.

1. Change the[TV's aspect ratio](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-aspect-ratio-1846860) mode. One should typically view content formatted for a 16:9 TV in a**Widescreen** or**Wide** picture size mode.  
 However, if you're viewing older 4:3 content, look for a**4:3 Aspect Ratio** or**Normal** picture size setting. It will display the content with black bars on either side, which is the correct way to view 4:3 content on a 16:9 widescreen TV.
2. Change the aspect ratio of the input device connected to your TV. DVD players, Blu-Ray players, game consoles, streaming sticks, and other devices connected to your TV often have an aspect ratio setting.  
 It should default to a setting appropriate to your TV, but, in rare cases, you will need to set it manually.

## How to Fix a TV With Motion Issues

 A modern TV displays various content with different frame rates and uses an onboard processor to smooth motion. Not everyone likes the results, however.

 In general, you should turn off a TV's motion clarity setting if the TV's image appears too smooth.

 Select a less aggressive motion clarity settings if you see halos, blocks, or other issues around fast-moving objects.

 Increase the motion clarity setting if you think the image stutters or has a low frame rate.
