##  What Are the Level Types in 'Royal Match'?

 All_Royal Match_ levels involve you making matches to clear them. However, while there are only a few types of tiles, level goals can change slightly. Here’s a quick overview of the different level types in_Royal Match_ .

![Examples of levels in 'Royal Match'](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Cxbib_KpUl8jr0FcV_UyxochdZU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Royal-Match-Level-Examples-270e213126044b52806878f4e04b6663.jpg)

 In all cases, be sure to check your objective before you start a level. That way, you won’t waste any turns trying to complete something that is unnecessary.

* **Achieving a target** . Look at the top left of the screen during a level to see what targets you need to achieve. Do so within the move limit that has been assigned to you. Early levels tend to have fewer targets than later ones.
* **King’s Nightmare** . King’s Nightmare unlocks after completing a certain number of levels. These are optional, but you’ll earn 50 coins for completing them. They work as a form of puzzle. Sometimes, you may need to complete an objective within a strict time limit. Others may have you creating a path for water to flow from one side of the screen to the other.
* **Bonus levels** . On the last level of each area, you unlock a Bonus Level. This stage is solely for collecting coins, which you can use to buy power-ups. These levels are short, and you can't fail them, but you can strategize to get as many coins as possible.

##  How to Advance to New Levels in 'Royal Match'

 When[ playing_Royal Match_ ](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-play-royal-match-8645995) , whatever the level, there are some key things you can do to advance faster. Here are some tips to keep in mind.  

* **Know your objective** . Different levels have different targets. The number of moves you have available to you is limited, so make sure that each move counts by knowing what you’re trying to do.
* **Plot out your moves** . Strategy is important in_Royal Match_ , so be sure to plan ahead. Before making a move, take a look and see how the move will affect the rest of the board–not just where you’re working.
* **Save some of your moves for boosters** . Boosters that you can use mid-level are invaluable, but you don’t want to waste them (even though power-ups like the Arrow and Cannon don't use moves). Saving a Light Ball for later on, for example, can make sure you can target exactly the tiles you need to clear to meet your goal.
* **Consider using pre-game boosters** . Other boosters are only available before you start playing a level. Save these for levels marked as Hard or Super Hard, and only use them after you attempt to complete it once. Sometimes, you get lucky, and even a Super Hard level ends up surprisingly easy.

##  What Is the Hardest Level in 'Royal Match'?

 With thousands of levels to choose from, there’s no one specific level that is particularly hard in_Royal Match_ . However, generally, levels that are multiples of 100 or even 50 do tend to be more challenging.  

 Rather than relying on level numbers, look for a Hard or Super Hard icon next to the level. That means the level is more difficult than average, whether limiting your moves substantially, having a tight target requirement, or including several tile types that require multiple hits or matches to clear.

 When you see a level described as Hard or Super Hard, it’s a good time to use your pre-game boosters to give you a better chance of success.
