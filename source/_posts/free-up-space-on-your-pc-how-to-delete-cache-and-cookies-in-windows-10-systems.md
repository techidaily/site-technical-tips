## Effortlessly Start Your PC in Safe Mode on Windows 11 - A Comprehensive Guide to All 4 Strategies and Their Images

![How to start Windows 10 in Safe Mode feature image](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/How-to-start-Windows-10-in-Safe-Mode-feature-image-1200x675.jpg)

 Safe Mode is a way to run Windows in its most basic form. It uses only absolutely essential files and drivers.

 For example, in Safe Mode, your screen will display only 16 colors and a very low resolution, and you won’t be able to print documents or hear audio. It also won’t load many programs in the background.

Safe Mode is designed to help you troubleshoot computer problems.

 Sometimes Windows 10 will automatically start in Safe Mode (e.g. if it has a problem loading normally). But sometimes you’ll need to start it in Safe Mode manually (e.g. if you get a blue screen error every time you start Windows).

This article explains how to manually start Windows 10 in safe mode.

## 4 ways to start Windows 10 in Safe Mode

1. [**Start Safe Mode by pressing F8 at startup**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. **[Start Safe Mode by turning off your PC 3 times](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## **Method 1: Start Safe Mode by pressing F8 at startup**

**IMPORTANT:** This method must be manually enabled from within Windows. If you haven't already enabled it, and you can't access Windows to do so, [skip to method 2 below](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/).

### First, you have to enable the F8 key method

 On Windows 7, you could press the F8 key as your computer was booting to access the Advanced Boot Options menu. From there, you could access Safe Mode.

 But on Windows 10, the F8 key method doesn’t work by default. You have to manually enable it.

Here’s how to get the F8 key to start Safe Mode in Windows 10:

 1) Click the**Windows start menu** and type**cmd** , then click**Run as administrator** :

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Start-command-prompt-as-admin.png)

2) Copy this command:

**bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy**

 3) Paste the copied command into the Command Prompt (right-click in the Command Prompt to paste), then press the**Enter** key on your keyboard.

4) Reboot your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Now you can start Safe Mode using the F8 key

 Now that you’ve enabled the F8 method, you can use it to start Safe Mode:

1) Ensure your computer is turned off.

2) Turn your computer on.

3) Before anything appears on your screen, press**F8** repeatedly until the Boot Options menu below displays. Then select**Safe Mode** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/safe-mode-1.jpg)

 If the Boot Options menu above doesn’t display, and instead Windows just launches normally, it’s likely that you didn’t press F8 early enough.

## **Method 2: Start Safe Mode by turning off your PC 3 times**

 If you’re unable to launch Windows, and you haven’t enabled the F8 method above, this is how to start Safe Mode:

1) Ensure your computer is off.

2) Press the power button to turn on your PC, and when you see the small spinning circle of dots that indicates Windows is starting, press and hold the power button until your PC shuts down. You’ll have to hold it for 4-5 seconds.

 Do this again, and then again. After you’ve done it 3 times, start your computer again and let it run. It should now go into Automatic Repair mode:
