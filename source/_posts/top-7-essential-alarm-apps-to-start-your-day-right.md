![An image of the Day One app on various devices.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tCh3KuRf5xBGfwh3QrMaqMP3l5Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-10-best-journal-apps-for-2018-4175848-4-5ba930e0c9e77c0050f50dc9.jpg)

 Day One

 What We Like

* Option to create multiple journals.
* There's a nifty dark mode for writing in lower light.
* IFTTT integration for automatic journal entries.
* Available for Android and iOS.

 What We Don't Like

* It's inaccessible from a web browser.
* There's a Mac app, but no options for PC users.

 Similar to Journey, Day One features an interface that's clean, minimal, and very pleasing to the eye. Despite its simple look, it packs all the features you'd want in a powerful journal app.

 Day One offers users unlimited entries in one journal, including one photo per entry, and syncing across devices (iPads, Apple Watches, iPhones, Macs, and Android). The free tier also provides secure cloud backup, Face ID or Touch ID protection, search, tags, maps, content exports, and book printing, among many others.

 The Premium subscription ups the ante by allowing users to have multiple unlimited journals and entries with media uploads, IFTTT support, and scanning to PDF capabilities.

## [Great Diary App for Quick, Short Journal or Diary Entries: Write Diary](https://www.writediary.com/)

![A screenshot of the Diary app in a YouTube video.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sDR1q8jXLmelVkkBdWdhC8UwxOk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-10-best-journal-apps-for-2018-4175848-9-5bd7142346e0fb00516269e8.jpg)

 What We Like

* Share entries via email and other platforms.
* Insert popular emojis directly into entries.

 What We Don't Like

* Only available on Android and via the web.
* Occasional pop-up ads with free version.

 If you're looking for an app that makes it as quick, easy, and effortless as possible to start and keep a diary or journal, Write Diary has you covered.

 Like other popular journaling apps, Write Diary lets users customize the look by adjusting background colors and fonts. This program also incorporates emojis, a search function, pin protection, reminders, and syncing between the web and mobile apps.

 While the app is only available for Androids and the interface isn't as streamlined as some, it's a simple, yet powerful journal app that combines an easy-to-use interface with more advanced features.

 What We Like

* Inspirational questions and prompts.
* Personalize journal entries with images, etc.

 What We Don't Like

* Only available on iOS. No web or Android support.
* Password protection and other features require purchase.

 Grid Diary puts a unique spin on journaling by displaying a series of different questions in a grid-style layout, essentially making it easier for you to keep a diary or journal.

 The built-in library of suggested prompts are available for inspiration so you never get stuck with writer's block. You can add images to entries and use tagging and categories to give you a calendar view to create and keep track of goals.

 Personalization with photos and stickers is free, but more color customization and advanced features, like password protection and cloud storage syncing, require either a monthly subscription or one-time purchase. This app is also exclusive to Apple device users.

## [Capture Your Exeriences Without Having to Write Anything: Daylio](https://daylio.net/)

![Two screenshots of the Daylio app for Android.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UUehjK1oo74BecN1pvVsRaGVSmM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-10-best-journal-apps-for-2018-4175848-10-5bd717d2c9e77c007c911182.jpg)

 What We Like

* Ideal if who want to journal without writing.
* A smart interface and beautiful icons.
* You can always add notes to your entries.

 What We Don't Like

* No traditional writing options for wordier entries.
* Some features are Android-specific.

 Not so much into writing, but want to find a super quick and easy way to record the things you experience in a day? Daylio is a micro-diary app that lets you simply pick your mood state and activities so you can spend more time doing things and less time writing.

 The layout is clean and easy to use, with attractive icons for recording daily updates about your activities and moods. You can customize the look by choosing different colors and also add text to entries if you'd like to include some written details—though more traditional journaling isn't supported.

 With the free version, you can view your data at a glance, but a paid subscription offers more advanced metrics, and unlimited library of moods, automatic back-ups, and an ad-free experience. These premium features are available on Android only.
