## The Ultimate Gamers' PC Build on a Dime: Maximizing Power with an RTX 4070 & 2TB Storage - Score Your Piece This Prime Day

Nvidia's RTX 4070 GPU makes our list of[best graphics cards](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gpus,4380.html) thanks to its strong balance of price to performance. The card is great for 1440p gaming, provides strong ray tracing performance, and supports other DLSS and DLSS 3 for higher frame rates.  
  
 Normally, if you want to buy a PC with an RTX 4070 inside, you must spend $1,400 or more and expect an SSD that's 1TB unless you pay quite a bit extra. However, with all the great Prime Day tech deals we're seeing today on Amazon and competitors such as Newegg, I was able to put together a list of parts you can buy for $1,000, which will get you a system with an RTX 4070 GPU, 2TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD, AMD Ryzen 5 CPU and 32GB of RAM.  
  
 Here's the parts list for a $1,000 RTX 4070 build.

 Let's talk about what I chose, why and how you can take it a step further if you're willing to spend over $1,000\. Our CPU is an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, which is currently[on sale for $114](<https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftarget.georiot.com%2FProxy.ashx%3Ftsid%3D45723%26GR%255FURL%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Famazon.com%252FAMD-Ryzen-5600X-12-Thread-Processor%252Fdp%252FB08166SLDF%252Fref%253Dasc%255Fdf%255FB08166SLDF%252F%253Ftag%253Dhawk-future-20%2526ascsubtag%253Dtomshardware-us-7812750928688159790-20>) . That gets you a 65W processor with 6 cores, 12 threads and a max boost clock of 4.6 GHz. Very importantly, it comes with a CPU cooler in the box, saving us the cost of buying one.

 Now, admittedly, any Ryzen 5000 series processor is a last-gen CPU, with the Ryzen 7000 series having been out for nearly two years and the Ryzen 9000 series on the way. However, these chips are still decent and quite popular and, because they use DDR4 RAM and less-expensive motherboards than the newer models, they are also budget-friendly.  
  
 It's worth pointing to our excellent[CPU vs GPU upgrade guide](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/cpu-vs-gpu-upgrade-benchmarks-testing) , where we looked at four different CPUs and four different GPUs to show how component choices could impact overall performance. The Ryzen 5 5600X should be somewhat faster than the old Core i7-8700K we used in those tests, but not as fast as the Core i9-11900K. The RTX 4070 meanwhile basically matches the previous generation RTX 3080 in performance, meaning if you look at the performance scaling of the 8700K with the 3080, you can see where the older CPU may reduce framerates in games. TLDR: An older CPU may hurt quite a bit for 1080p gaming, but at 1440p it's less of a factor.  
  
 For our motherboard, we're going with Gigabyte's B550M DS3H AC, which is[on sale at Newegg for $89](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3Dtomshardware-us-9269674164867474010%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fgigabyte-b550m-ds3h-ac%252Fp%252FN82E16813145250%253FItem%253DN82E16813145250) . Not only is this a great price, but you get a couple of standout features for it. First, there's built-in Wi-Fi 6, which is more than adequate for most people. There's also Q-Flash, a feature that allows you to update the BIOS without having a CPU installed. Some motherboards don't support 5000 series CPUs out of the box and, if this one doesn't, you can always install an update using a flash drive.

When we[reviewed the 5700X3D](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-7-5700x3d-cpu-review) , we called it a "value gaming masterpiece." The CPU comes with 100MB of L2 / L3 cache, which allows it to dominate CPU-limited games at 1080p and 1440p. The other chips with this amount of cache cost a lot more.

 If it were us, we'd spend the extra money on the case and probably on the CPU / cooler as well. But when building a PC, you always have to make trade-offs that fit your budget.
