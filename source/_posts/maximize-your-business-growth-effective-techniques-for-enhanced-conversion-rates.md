Hi,

 I purchased Epubor Vitalsource downloader. I was trying to convert a textbook into a pdf file, but it failed. There was a output file, in which there is a phrase "Please refresh your browser" with a picture of a robot on all pages. I tried many times, but all failed. Please let me know how to solve this problem.

 Thanks

[Kindle app requires update to view content](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/26/2023 5:14:25 AM 

I borrowed 2 books and when I attempt to open them in the Kindle app for PC I get this message: Your kindle app requires an update to view this content. Click here to download and install the free update.   
 I borrowed other books and they open just fine and I can use Epubor Ultimate to convert them.  
 Has Amazon changed file types or what? Any ideas?  
 Thanks

[Convert MyMustReads content](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/20/2020 3:42:55 AM 

I'm trying to support my local independent bookstores by purchasing ebooks through them. Many of them use a system by Hummingbird Digital Media called MyMustReads. It really locks the access tightly, but I want to be able to read it on any of my devices. Do you have a solution for converting MyMustReads files? And for removing their DRM?  
 Many thanks!

[Free trial?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/14/2019 3:27:54 AM 

I was looking to test the epubor product by converting an .aax file to mp3\. It only converted 10 minutes, which is understandable under a free trial basis. However, I need to know how it will parse a 10 hour audio book .aax. Will it break it up into 10 minute segments? Will it break it up into chapters as audible does? What??

[Epubor for iPad?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 12/28/2020 5:53:36 PM 

Currently you must use the epubor converter application on a desktop (converter app isn’t compatible with iPad), correct? I purchased epubor ultimate and it’s been awesome - I convert using desktop then upload files to cloud to access on iPad (just wondered if I could further streamline by doing the actual conversion on the iPad). Thanks!

[How do I delete a book after it is converted](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 12/6/2019 2:42:56 AM 

I have 13 books down the left side of Epubor Ultimate v3.0.11.1025\. I drag a book that has already been converted to the right side of the window, select it, right click, and select Remove Selected. It removes it from the right window but leaves it in the list on the left. How do I remove it from there?

[Can I get a registration code # for my converter software?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/22/2019 6:50:26 AM 

Can I get a registration code # for my converter software so it will work everytime I open it, even offline? Currently, I have to connect to the internet and input my email address for the program to convert the entire file. Otherwise, all it does is convert 3 minutes, as a trial version.
