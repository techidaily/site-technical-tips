##  How to Connect AirPods to a Nintendo Switch 

 The Nintendo Switch lacked Bluetooth support when it first launched. But, thanks to a September 2021 update, gamers can now connect devices like AirPods to the console.  

 You can save up to 10 devices on a Switch, but you can only use one at a time. The Switch permits only two wireless Joy-Cons while using Bluetooth audio, and Bluetooth microphones don't work at all.

 Here's how to pair AirPods with the Nintendo Switch:

1. Put your AirPods into pairing mode. Open the case with the AirPods inside and press and hold the button the back of the case until the light flashes white.
2. Turn on your Switch and navigate to**System Settings** \>**Bluetooth Audio** \>**Pair Device** .

##  How to Connect AirPods to Nintendo Switch With a Bluetooth Adapter 

 Getting your Apple AirPods connected to your Nintendo Switch via a third-party Bluetooth dongle or adapter is straightforward and mostly follows the same steps required for[ syncing AirPods to a Windows 10 PC](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-connect-airpods-to-pc-windows-10-4692881) or[ connecting AirPods to an Android smartphone or tablet](https://www.lifewire.com/do-airpods-work-with-android-4771417) .

 The LED lights on the case and transmitter should begin flashing but will stop once the pairing is complete. You can now use your Apple AirPods with your Nintendo Switch.

##  What You Need to Connect AirPods to Switch Via a Third-Party Dongle 

 Before Nintendo added Bluetooth functionality to the Switch, gamers had to use third-party solutions to get wireless audio to work with it. These methods should still work if you prefer to use them.

 To connect AirPods to a Switch via a dongle, you need:

* A Nintendo Switch
* The AirPods case
* The AirPods in the case
* A third-party Bluetooth adapter that's compatible with the console

 The Bluetooth adapter connects to the Switch via the USB port on the bottom of the console or via the USB port on the Dock if you want to play on your TV.  

 Some manufacturers explicitly design Bluetooth dongles for the Nintendo Switch, which you can find in video game stores and on Amazon. The most popular one seems to be the HomeSpot Bluetooth Transmitter, while the Ldex Nintendo Bluetooth Transmitter and GuliKit Bluetooth Adapter are also solid options. All three can connect to both the Switch and the Dock.

##  Some Tips for Using AirPods With Switch Consoles 

 The process for connecting AirPods to Nintendo Switch consoles is pretty simple, but there are still some things you may want to keep in mind.

* **You may need to re-sync your AirPods with other devices** : Pairing your AirPods with multiple devices can often cause conflicts that may require re-pairing when switching between your Switch, smartphone, and laptop.
* **Remember to charge your Bluetooth adapter** : The Nintendo Switch cannot charge connected accessories, so you need to make sure that whatever Bluetooth transmitter you buy is fully charged before using it.
* **Remember to charge your Switch** : Because a Bluetooth adapter connects to the USB port on the Nintendo Switch, you can't plug the Switch in and charge it while you use it. One way to get around this is to have the Switch docked, but this won't be an option for Switch Lite owners as that model doesn't support the TV Dock.
* **This method may not work with voice chat** : While some titles such as[ Fortnite and Warframe support voice chat through the Switch](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-setup-nintendo-switch-microphone-4692846) , most other games require you to connect to the Nintendo Switch smartphone app. You can only use AirPods with one device at a time.
