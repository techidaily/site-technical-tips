## When Will the Google Pixel 10 Be Released?

 Google makes a new phone every year. The[Pixel 9](https://www.lifewire.com/google-pixel-9-8630767) will be Google's next smartphone, so the Pixel 10 release date won't be until late 2025.

## Google Pixel 10 Price Rumors

 There's no concrete information on Pixel 10 pricing yet, but if the Pixel 9 is priced the same as the Pixel 8 (we think it will be), there's a good chance we'll see an increase for the Pixel 10\. This could put the base model around $750, and the Pixel 10 Pro could follow suit, exceeding $1000.  

 Of course, this is pure speculation. Google might adjust pricing based on market trends, hardware, and competitor offerings.

## Pre-Order Information

 Pixel 10 pre-orders are unavailable this far out. Typically, Google opens pre-orders a couple of weeks before the official release date, so you should be able to grab one in late 2025\. We'll have the date and time figured out as that time approaches.

## Google Pixel 10 Specs and Features

 This is the list of features and changes we're expecting from the Pixel 10:

* **Next-Gen Tensor Chip** : Google might introduce the[TSMC-made Tensor G5 chip](https://www.androidauthority.com/tsmc-tensor-g5-proof-pixel-10-3445056/) with the Pixel 10\. This processor could bring significant improvements in performance, battery efficiency, and AI capabilities. Compared to Samsung's 3nm process, TSMC's reportedly delivers[10-20 percent higher performance](https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=219277) .
* **Ultrasonic Fingerprint Sensor** : The latest Pixel phones have an optical fingerprint sensor. We hope Google will improve this next year by adding an ultrasonic sensor to the Pixel 10, like the one used in the Galaxy S24 and other top smartphones. An ultrasonic sensor uses sound waves to create a 3D map of your finger (as opposed to light to make a 2D image), making it faster and more secure than an optical sensor.
* **Camera Enhancements** : Pixels are known for their exceptional cameras, and the Pixel 10 is expected to continue that trend. If the physical cameras themselves aren't upgraded, Android 16 will surely provide some software-based improvements.
* **Machine Learning** : Google is expected to integrate even more machine learning features into the Pixel 10\. These upgrades could include smarter object recognition for photos, improved voice commands, and more personalized user experiences.
* **More Storage and RAM** : All Pixel 8 models start with 128 GB of storage, but only the Pro model offers 512 GB or 1 TB. We'd like to see some changes: 256 GB as the starting storage for all models and 512 GB as an option for the standard Pixel 10\. Regarding RAM, we believe 12 GB should become the standard instead of 8 GB for the base model.
