If you want to jailbreak your Kindle devices, you must downgrade Kindle firmware firstly. In this post, you will find it's very easy to downgrade Kindle Paperwhite or other Kindle versions. You do not have to check other places. Here you will get all things about downgrading your Kindle devices. Please back up the "documents" data in your Kindle before you start to downgrade.

**[Want to jailbreak your Kindle? Try this method to jailbreak your Kindle.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)**

Note: Before downgrade your Kindle devices with below firmware, you must check whether your KSN suited with the specific firmware. Skip here to [Confirm your Kindle Model](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). And your KSN must be in Table 1 before you install the specific firmware. If you install the wrong firmware, your Kindle device may turn into a brick.

1 Download Specific Kindle Firmware 

Following .bin files are prepared for you to downgrade your Kindle firmware. With the specific firmware includes Kindle Paperwhite firmware, you can downgrade your Kindle easily. These downgraded firmware files can recover your Kindle to the factory default firmware version.

Please mention that the size of Kindle downgrade firmware is bigger than usual firmware files. Your Kindle device must have enough space for these downgraded firmware files. And so far Kindle firmware 5.8.8 can't be downgraded.

 MD5: 8f1e7c9124a2b12e643b15447d80feae

**2\.** Downgrade Kindle Voyage Firmware

**5\.** Downgrade Kindle Touch 2 Firmware

update\_KT2\_5.6.0\_initial.bin (730MB): [Download](http://www.mediafire.com/file/hg92x3dv1lvpo51/update%5FKT2%5F5.6.0%5Finitial.bin)  
 MD5: d85a86f5c75b4b9d43648f3b6afd2e84

**6\.** Downgrade Kindle Touch 3 Firmware

update\_KT3\_5.8.0\_initial.bin (736MB): [Download](http://www.mediafire.com/file/bzmn67fbqfj1mie/update%5FKT3%5F5.8.0%5Finitial.bin)  
 MD5: 3f1a5294e1bca8c4fa7ca2762c5b4505

The number in the .bin file represents the Kindle version. Even though the current version of your Kindle device matches the version of the downgraded firmware, you must download and install the specific .bin file to prepare to downgrade and jailbreak. Please be sure the MD5 code suited with the downloaded .bin files. 

2 Downgrade Kindle with Speicific Firmware 

 **1.** Turn on the airplane mode and keep your Kindle off-line.

 **2.** Keep full power of your Kindle.

 **3.** Remove your Kindle device passcode and turn off parental control.

 **4.** Collect your Kindle to a computer with a USB cable. 

 **5.** When the Kindle disk displays, you can copy the downloaded .bin firmware file to the Kindle root directory (at the same level with the documents folder).

 **6.** Eject your Kindle from the computer.

 **7.** Come back to the home screen of your Kindle device. Tap setting icon and choose the device option. Then tap "Update your Kindle".

 **8.** The degradation will take some time. Be patient.

Tip 2: Fix Kindle Paperwhite 3 Downgrading Problem 

Most of the time, KPW3 can be downgraded well according to above methods. But once in a while the Kindle Paperwhite 3 may turn in wrong conditions such as stuck at the start interface or loop restarting. Don't be panic. You will get rid of this trouble.

When the KPW3 was in a wrong condition, you must plug it in a computer and decide which methods you could try.

1\. If the Kindle disk can be displayed when plugging in the computer

**How to fix:** Copy the downloaded .bin firmware file to the Kindle root directory. Then eject your KPW3 device from the computer and remove the USB cable. Long press the Kindle power button 40 seconds to reboot.

2\. If the Kindle disk only appeared when you reboot the KPW3 device

**How to fix:** Create a new empty folder named `DO_FACTORY_RESTORE` without a suffix name. Then long press the Kindle power button 40 seconds to reboot. At that moment the Kindle disk appears, you must copy this created folder to the Kindle root directory. Then reboot the Kindle device again. After that, you can copy the downloaded .bin file to the Kindle root directory. Eject your Kindle from the computer and reboot again.

There is no need to worry about Kindle Paperwhite downgrade. With these specific Kindle firmware, you can downgrade and jailbreak your Kindle devices with no limitation. Look forward to hearing your good news!

I have a Kindle Voyage, 5.8.8 serial number starts with 9013\. Whenever I download the update\_KV file to my kindle and safely remove the device from my computer the option to update my Kindle is greyed out and the update\_KV file has been removed from my Kindle. Any help would be appreciated. I have tried everything I can think of up to and including resetting the device.

Unfortunatelly, I have upgraded my Kindle Paperwhite 3 to version 5.8.9.2\. Is there any chance to do a downgrade, or will be? The problem is that my Kindle automatically deletes the downgrade file.

I have a PW3 with a Firmware V. 5.8.9 and a SN: G090 G1.

 I tried to copy the 5.7.4 firmware into the root folder but the PW3 erases it immediately after. Impossible at the moment to do the downgrade in my device. :-(

Hi!

 I have a "B0C6, 90C6 Kindle Basic (2014) KT2, BASIC" device. I copied the "update\_KT2\_5.6.0\_initial.bin" file into the root directory. Update ... remained gray. In fact, the .bin file has been deleted!  
 What happened? What can I do?

Hello,

 As far as I known, firmware that newer than 5.8.9 is not allowed to downgrade. This means if your Kindle firmware was newer than 5.8.9, you can't downgrade the software unless jailbreak the Kindle device!

I probably should have read the comments first. Can't downgrade my 5.12.1 kindle, the option for it is greyed out, so that was a waste of time, one day I hope it can be jail broken so I can use the book cover screen savers.

If your kindle firmware is later than 5.8.9.0.1, you need to downgrade it for jailbreak.
