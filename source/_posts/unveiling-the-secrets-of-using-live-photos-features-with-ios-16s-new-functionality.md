## How to Use Live Activities on iPhone (iOS 16)

 Live Activities provide a handy way to get at-a-glance information and features from compatible apps on your lock screen. With them, there's no need to unlock your iPhone or go into apps themselves.

 To use Live Activities, you need to be running[iOS 16](https://www.lifewire.com/ios-16-news-and-rumors-5509306) and up. As noted, on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, Live Activities also take advantage of the space offered by the Dynamic Island.

 To enable live activities on an iPhone, follow these steps:

1. Tap**Settings** .
2. Tap**Face ID & Passcode** .

3. Enter your passcode.
4. In the**Allow Access when Locked** section, move the**Live Activities** slider to**on/green** .

 Which Live Activities are available in your apps, and how you activate them, differs based on which apps you use. You can clear a Live Activity from your lock screen by swiping from right to left on it.

 On iPhones running iOS 16.2 and up, you can set Live Activities to update sports scores more frequently. First, enable this option in**Settings** \>**TV** \>**Live Activities** \> move to**on/green** the sliders for both**Allow Live Activities** and**More Frequent Updates** . Then, in the TV app, tap the game and, on its detail page, tap**Follow** . The Live Activity for that game on your lock screen is updated frequently.

## What Are Live Activities?

 Live Activities are small views of apps you can add to your iPhone Lock screen.

 They surface crucial information from apps; examples include a sports score, where your food delivery is on its way to you, weather information, and more.

 As their name suggests, Live Activities are updated regularly and let you get important information with just a glance at your screen (great with the iPhone 14's always-on screen) and without opening an app.

 Think of them as being like[lock screen widgets](https://www.lifewire.com/customize-iphone-lockscreen-5443101) or[notifications](https://www.lifewire.com/notification-center-iphone-1999192) that update in close to real time and that you can interact with.

## Live Activities on iPhone 14 Pro and Up

 On the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, Live Activities also take advantage of the Dynamic Island to provide updates while you use other apps, not just from the lock screen.

 On these models, information appears in the Dynamic Island in a collapsed form at all times. Sometimes, the Dynamic Island expands to show something particularly important, and you can tap the Dynamic Island to jump into that app.

![Examples of Live Activities on the lock screen and in the Dynamic Island.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/V-2k8wH_Idts_JUaWWAvgskSiAM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/C1-UseLiveActivitiesoniPhone-annotated-c36b823b25554946b7e02eb630ec2033.jpg)

 For example, when listening to a song in Music, the Dynamic Island shows a thumbnail of the album art for the song you're listening to and a tap takes you to the album in Music.

 In another example, a sports game that you're following shows the team logos and the current score in the Dynamic Island. When the game ends, the Dynamic Island expands to show the final.
