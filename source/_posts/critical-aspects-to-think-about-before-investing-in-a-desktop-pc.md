## 9 Ways to Fix the Problem

 A number of issues could be causing the keyboard to stop typing. Here are some solutions we've seen work:  

1. Make sure you have the correct text field selected. Click directly in the section where you want to type, then try typing again.  
 This is an easy mistake to make. Watch where you've clicked to ensure the keystrokes are sent there. The app must be in focus or what you type won't show up in the right place.
2. Close and reopen the app you're trying to type in. Temporary software glitches happen all the time, and restarting the program is the fastest way around them.
3. Turn on the keyboard if it has an on/off switch. If it's on and is battery-powered, check the batteries or ensure it's at least somewhat charged.
4. Check the keyboard's connection to your computer. We recommend doing the following, depending on the keyboard you have:  
   * For a USB keyboard, unplug it and plug it back in.  
   * For a wireless one, detach the USB dongle for a few seconds and then reattach it.  
   * [Toggle Bluetooth off on your PC](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-on-bluetooth-in-windows-11-5216193) and then switch it back on, making sure your keyboard connects after a few seconds. You may need to [pair the keyboard again](https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-a-bluetooth-device-2640340) if it doesn't.  
   * Plug the keyboard or dongle into a different USB port.  
   * Try a different cable if it uses a detachable USB cable.  
   * Try it on a different computer. If it doesn't work there, it's likely dead.

5. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . If your computer is responsive, use the mouse to restart it. If it's not responsive,[fix your frozen computer](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-frozen-computer-5217030) first.
6. Clean the keyboard. Dirt stuck under the keys can keep them from working correctly. This could be why some keys work but others don't.  
 If you find sticky residue under the keys, it may have failed due to spilled liquid. Cleaning may help, and you can sometimes even[save a laptop keyboard after a spill](https://www.lifewire.com/steps-to-laptop-spill-repair-2378134) , but it’s also possible it's been permanently damaged.
7. [Open Device Manager](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-device-manager-2626075) and enable the keyboard. This is relevant if you've taken that step to[disable your keyboard in Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/disable-laptop-keyboard-in-windows-11-5196395) . Some people do this for laptop keyboards, and you'll probably remember if you did that, but it doesn't hurt to check.
8. [Update your drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . A driver installation is almost always necessary if you have an advanced keyboard that hasn't been able to type right out of the box. However, even older keyboards that used to type just fine could use a driver update if the existing one was deleted or needs a bug fix.  
 If your keyboard stopped working after an update, you may need to[roll back your driver](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) instead.
9. [Disable sticky and filter keys](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-off-sticky-keys-windows-4692841) . If your keyboard seems to work but is behaving unexpectedly and doesn't type the keys you're pressing, you may be able to fix it by disabling sticky, filter, and toggle keys.

## Why the Keyboard Quit Working

 Some of the reasons a keyboard might be unresponsive include:

* **The computer is frozen** : If the computer or an app is locked up, you won’t be able to type.
* **The keyboard is disconnected** : The keyboard may have been unplugged, ran out of batteries, or the wireless connection disrupted.
* **The intended text field isn’t selected** : If the text field you’re trying to type in has been deselected, your keyboard will either not type or it will be typing somewhere off-screen (so it appears to not work).
* **Software or driver problems** : Your keyboard driver or some other software issue may have caused it to quit working.

 FAQ

* What do I do if my laptop keyboard won't type?  
 It's unlikely that your laptop's keyboard is suffering from a connection problem since it's built into the system, but it is possible that the[keyboard lock](https://www.lifewire.com/lock-your-keyboard-temporarily-5072812) may have accidentally been turned on. The steps to unlock a locked laptop keyboard can differ depending on the make and model, but look for a function key with a keyboard icon and press it to see if that solves the problem. If not, look up the process for unlocking your specific laptop model's keyboard and try that.
* What should I do if my Chromebook keyboard stops typing?  
 Restart your Chromebook and try typing again. The issue could also be caused by an error with your using account, so sign out and sign back in with[Guest Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-chromebook-guest-mode-4842588) to test the keyboard again. If the keyboard works in Guest Mode, delete the problem account and reconnect it.
