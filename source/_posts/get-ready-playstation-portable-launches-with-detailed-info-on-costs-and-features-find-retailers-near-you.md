##  PlayStation Portal Specs and Features 

 PlayStation Portal has all the main features of the DualSense, including adaptive triggers, vibration, and a speaker. Sony has opted for an LCD screen rather than OLED, likely to help keep the production costs down.

 Unlike the Switch, Portal isn't truly portable because it only works within the vicinity of your PS5\. In that regard, it's more similar to the[ Nintendo Wii U's Gamepad](https://www.lifewire.com/wii-portable-game-system-1126270) than the Switch.

 The screen, which is capable of up to 1080p resolution at 60fps, is bigger than every version of the Switch. Here's a comparison:

* PlayStation Portal: 8-inch LCD
* Switch OLED: 7-inch OLED
* Switch (original): 6.2-inch LED
* Switch Lite: 5.5-inch LED

 The peripheral also has wireless internet capabilities, which is how it streams games from the PS5\. You'll need at least 5Mbps to use it, but Sony recommends an internet speed of at least 15Mbps. It works via[ Remote Play](https://www.lifewire.com/remote-play-ps5-games-on-android-5089611) , which typically lets you stream games to phones, tablets, Macs, and PCs. The Portal is basically a dedicated Remote Play device.
