 Tap the**Share** icon >**Save to Files** to save the image to any service you set up in Files, such as iCloud Drive or Google Drive, or on your device.

 Before using iCloud Photos on your iOS or iPadOS device, you must turn on the iCloud Photo Library: Select**Settings** \>**Apple ID** \>**iCloud** \>**Photos** . Then, complete the following steps to access your photos:  

1. On your iOS device, tap**Photos** .
2. Select**Library** .
3. In the options bar, tap**Years** ,**Months** , or**Days** to view images by that period, or select**All Photos** .
