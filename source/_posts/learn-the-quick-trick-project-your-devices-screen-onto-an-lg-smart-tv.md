## Charge Your Mobile Device on the Go: No Charger Needed
### What to Know

* Plug your phone into your laptop or an alternate USB port.
* Purchase a battery pack, wireless charging pad, solar charger, or an emergency hand crank.
* If your vehicle doesn't have a USB port, buy an adapter for the lighter port.

 This article explains several ways to charge your phone if you don't have a phone charger. All of these methods require either a charging cable that's compatible with your iPhone or Android device, or a wireless charging pad.

## Use a USB Port to Charge Your Phone

 For this process, you need a charging cable that is compatible with your phone. You can plug your phone into your laptop for a quick charge or find alternate USB ports that can do the job.

 When you have the cord you need, plug the USB end of the charging cable into the USB port. Then plug the other end into your phone.

 Most[USB ports found in airports](https://www.lifewire.com/safely-use-airport-charging-stations-4690583) and some coffee shops provide enough power to charge a standard smartphone. Also, some hotels have USB ports built into lamps and bedside tables. They are usually of the[USB-A shape](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-a-connector-2626032) , which is the rectangle end of the cable you usually use to charge your phone.

## Charge Your Phone With a Battery Pack

 You’ll need to do a little advance planning to use this method. Here are a few things to keep in mind:  

* **Keep it handy** : Charge your battery pack in advance and remember to take it with you when you won't have access to your regular phone charger (or simply carry it with you at all times).
* **Plug and play** : Each battery pack will be slightly different, but typically all you need to do is to plug the charging cable into it and into your phone and turn it on.
* **Fast charging** : All[modern battery packs](https://www.lifewire.com/buying-guide-for-portable-usb-chargers-2740926) can supply enough power to charge your smartphone, although not all of them may support fast charging (even if your phone does).

## Hand-Crank Chargers for Emergency Phone Charges

 A hand-crank charger doesn't require any electrical power, making it a great choice for outdoor adventures or emergencies. To use a hand-crank charger, plug the charging cable into the charger and into your phone, and keep cranking until you get a usable charge.

 It may take some time before you get a usable charge. Some hand-crank models have batteries built in, so you could charge the battery and then use the battery to charge your phone.

## Use an Eco-Friendly Solar-Powered Charger

 Another great choice for outdoor adventures, a solar-powered charger only requires sunlight to run.

 Solar chargers typically work in one of two ways: Sunlight charges a battery in the unit, which is then used to charge the phone or the solar charger charges the phone directly.

 Setup and use is straightforward either way, and usually requires two steps:

* Set up the charger to collect sunlight, or place it on your backpack to charge it while hiking.
* Plug your charging cable into the charger and into your phone.

## Charge Your Phone With a Car Charger

[Most modern vehicles have USB ports](https://www.lifewire.com/why-do-car-radios-have-usb-ports-4044287) that you can use for charging mobile devices. If not, you can buy[an adapter that plugs into the lighter port](https://www.lifewire.com/finding-the-right-12v-usb-adapter-534755) .

 To use this method, start your car or turn it to accessory mode. Then pug one end of the charging cable into the car's USB port or adapter and the other end into your phone.

## Use a Wireless Charger for Easy Charging

 If your smartphone works with[wireless charging](https://www.lifewire.com/qi-wireless-charging-4151894) , you don't have to do anything other than place your phone on the charging pad.

 The urban myth that you can use fruit to charge your phone is[technically true](https://youtu.be/E-j8mPUDjRs) but requires a lot of fruit and additional equipment. Therefore, it is impractical and not recommended.
