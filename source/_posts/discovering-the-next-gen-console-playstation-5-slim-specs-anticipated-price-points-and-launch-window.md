## PS5 Slim Price 

 The PlayStation 5 Slim comes in two versions, just like the original. One has a disc drive, and the other is digital-only. We thought it would see a price cut over the original MSRP, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

 The version with a disc drive costs $499.99, while the Digital Edition runs $449.99\. That's no change from the present price. Sony is also offering a few add-ons.

 While the PS5 will come with a horizontal stand, you can pick up one to display your PS5 vertically separately. That costs $29.99.

 Additionally, if you get the Digital Edition and want to add a disc drive later, you can. It will be available for $79.99\. In this case, you're better off getting the one that comes with the drive already.

##  PlayStation 5 Slim Features & Specs 

 Per Sony, the new PS5 is more than 30% smaller (by volume), and 18 or 24% lighter (depending on model) than the original version. Rather than the current PS5's two side panels, the new ones have four: The top two are glossy, while the bottom ones are the same matte finish as the current lineup.

 The main reason for that change seems to be for attaching a disc drive later. The bottom panel comes off to let you install the peripheral.

 The new PlayStation 5 also comes with more storage: 1TB, which is a slight bump from the original's 825GB.

 The general specs remain basically the same; the chips may just be slightly smaller to allow for the slimmer form factor.
