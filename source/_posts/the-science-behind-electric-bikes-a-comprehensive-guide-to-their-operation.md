##  How Electric Motorcycles Work

 Electric motorcycles use their batteries to power an internal electric engine. After you switch on your vehicle, power travels from the batteries to the engine, and you can start driving as normal.

 How you check your battery percentage will vary slightly depending on the manufacturer. But in many cases, you'll see how much charge you have left by going to the menu on your electric motorcycle. Here, you should also see how many miles or kilometers the vehicle expects that this charge will last.

 When an electric motorbike has run out of battery, it's not like an e-bike where you can continue cycling with your feet. It's more like a car; you'll have to recharge your motorcycle before you can use it again.

 You can charge an electric motorbike at the same charging points where you'd "fill up" an electric car. If you can, it's worth finding a faster charging point if you're on the road. That way, you won't have to wait too long before you can head out again. If you're charging your motorbike overnight, you can afford to use a slower charger.

##  What's the Range of an Electric Motorcycle?

 Just like a car's gas mileage, the range of an electric motorcycle–that is, the distance it can travel before you need to recharge it–will vary between models.

 Some engines are more efficient or powerful than others, and battery capacity will be different. Other factors, like how fast you go, can also affect the overall range.

 You should expect a range of at least 100 miles for most electric motorcycles. Higher-end models boast ranges between 150 and 200 miles, though some can even double that. These figures are roughly equivalent to the mileage of a fuel-powered motorcycle.

 Just like when you're buying a car, the range should be an important factor in the model you choose.

##  Electric Motorcycles vs Gas Motorcycles

 An electric motorcycle runs entirely without gas, diesel, or petrol, and you have to use a charger to power them up. They run on a battery that you can recharge over and over again. Other than this, they aren't too different from traditional motorbikes.

 Like electric cars, scooters, and e-bikes, battery-powered motorbikes are becoming more popular. Besides not needing to pay for gas, electric motorcycles are also more environmentally friendly than their gas and petrol counterparts. Moreover, you often won't have to deal with the motor making as much noise.

 Not matter what kind of motorcycle you drive, don't forget your helmet.

##  Who Should Get an Electric Motorcycle?

 Not everyone would benefit from an electric motorcycle, but they're a great fit if either of the following describes you:

###  You Want to Save Money on Gas

 You'll still have to pay to use electric charging stations, but you often don't have to pay as much as you would to fill up your car. So, if you still want something to drive but would also like to save money, electric motorbikes are a great choice.

 In some countries, you can pay for electric charging stations via a subscription. If you plan to use your electric motorbike frequently, getting a subscription could be a worthwhile purchase.

###  You're Environmentally Conscious

 According to the[ US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/electric-vehicle-myths) , electric vehicles—including electric motorbikes—are often better for the environment than those that emit exhaust. While you still need to use electricity (that may also be generated by fossil fuels), the carbon footprint is lower than with an internal combustion engine.

 The lower carbon footprint includes both lifetime use and manufacturing. With these in mind, getting an electric motorbike is worth considering if you already have a motorcycle but want to consider your environmental impact.

 There are some[ reasons why people don't buy EVs](https://www.lifewire.com/reasons-people-dont-buy-evs-5201642) , which you should check out before deciding on a purchase.

##  How to Buy an Electric Motorcycle

 First, you need to have the necessary license for the vehicle you purchase. This requirement will differ depending on where you live, but you can always ask the manufacturer you plan to buy from if you're unsure.

 Once you have a license that lets you drive motorbikes, you can buy your vehicle online. Your best option is to go to the specific manufacturer's website and choose your preferred model.

 Electric motorcycle prices vary significantly, with some of the high-end options costing over $10,000\. You can buy electronic motorcycles designed for roads, in addition to various off-road options, and you can often get the vehicle delivered to your door. Think about where you're going to use your bike before purchasing it.

 Depending on where you live, you may also be able to purchase your bike via an electronic motorcycle dealership. It's worth[ asking yourself these questions before buying any EV](https://www.lifewire.com/questions-to-ask-before-buying-an-ev-5202902) .
