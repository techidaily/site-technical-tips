## Cause of Microsoft Edge Errors

 A lot goes on to make a web browser work correctly, so there's a wide variety of reasons Edge won't open or run properly:

* Too many tabs are open
* The cache is corrupt
* The program is hanging in the background
* Your user profile is corrupt
* The browser or device is outdated
* There's a faulty extension
* There's an internet-related issue
* The website is unsupported

 If you can't open a specific website, you'll save loads of time by[checking if the website is down](https://www.lifewire.com/is-website-down-3482172) . If just that one website doesn't work and Edge is running smoothly otherwise, don't bother following these steps. All you can do is wait for the site owner to address the problem.

## How to Fix Edge Not Opening and Similar Problems

 Follow these solutions in the order we've presented them here, checking after each one that Edge opens and works as intended.

1. [Close some tabs](https://www.lifewire.com/close-all-tabs-computer-android-browsers-4173831) . Too many websites running at once can make Edge run slowly as it demands more from your hardware. Closing the tabs you don't need to access right now is a quick way to improve performance.
2. [Clear the cache](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-cache-microsoft-edge-4156806) . This popular fix is easy to do (press**Ctrl** +**Shift** +**Del** ) and can address issues like sluggish websites, login issues, and outdated images.
3. Restart the browser. Simply close Edge, wait a few seconds, and then reopen it.
4. Shut down Edge in[Task Manager](https://www.lifewire.com/task-manager-2626025) . This step is relevant if Microsoft Edge won't open. What's happening here is that the browser hangs in the background, appearing to be closed when it isn't. Find it in the list, right-click the entry, and choose**End task** .

5. [Update Microsoft Edge](https://www.lifewire.com/update-microsoft-edge-5101627) to install any pending bug fixes. An unapplied update is a common reason for unexplained issues in browsers like Edge.

6. Rename your Edge profile. If it has corrupted data in it, there's a chance Edge won't open at all.  
 To do this,[open the AppData folder](https://www.lifewire.com/find-and-use-the-appdata-folder-in-windows-4771752) and navigate here:  
 `Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data`  
 If there's a folder in the User Data folder called**Default** , rename the folder to**DefaultOLD** .  
 This is useful exclusively if Edge doesn't open. If you don't see the Default folder, delete everything within the**User Data** folder, but back it up first (copy it to your Desktop).
7. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) or phone/tablet. A quick restart can often fix an unresponsive app.
8. [Check your internet connection](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-do-when-theres-no-wi-fi-internet-connection-2378240) . A poor connection to the internet can cause symptoms that feel like Edge isn't working. If Edge opens but you can't reach any websites, then it's likely that the issue is with your network or your[ISP's](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924) , not Microsoft Edge.
9. [Install the latest Windows operating system updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Updates to the Windows OS can address problems with the browser since Edge is integrated into Windows.
10. [Uninstall your extensions](https://www.lifewire.com/using-microsoft-edge-extensions-4156515) . Too many extensions running on some slower computers can pose a problem, but it's also possible that one or more extensions have bugs that are affecting how Edge works. You can always reinstall the extensions one by one to see which one is to blame.
11. [Free up disk space](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-free-up-space-disk-cleanup-windows-10-4771012) . If your device is low on free space, it can be challenging for programs like Edge to open and run correctly. Deleting large files and removing unnecessary software can be helpful if Edge doesn't open.  
 You can always upload files to an[online file storage service](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-cloud-storage-2438541) before deleting them from your device.
12. [Open an InPrivate window](https://www.lifewire.com/activate-inprivate-in-microsoft-edge-446308) . This is more of a workaround than a fix, but if you can't view one or two websites correctly or you're getting errors when you try to log in, you can often get around the problem by simply repeating the task in a private browsing window.
13. [Run some Windows troubleshooters](https://www.lifewire.com/run-diagnostics-on-windows-5214801) . Open the Settings app in Windows 11 or Windows 10 and search for**troubleshoot** to see your options. Run any troubleshooters that make sense for the problem you're having, such as**Network and Internet** or**Windows Store Apps** .
14. Disable your VPN. A virtual private network routes all your traffic through a server before it reaches the websites you're trying to visit, which introduces a whole new set of problems. If turning off the VPN fixes Edge, update the software or pick a different server next time.
15. Resync your Microsoft Edge Favorites. If your Favorites aren’t syncing between Microsoft Edge on different devices, make sure both versions of the app are up-to-date and that you've connected each device to the internet.  
 It may take a while, but they should sync automatically. If not, go to**Settings** \>**Profiles** \>**Sync** , and make sure**Sync** is enabled and your preferred data is selected.
16. Check your Microsoft accounts. Edge lets you log into multiple Microsoft accounts at the same time. If you have trouble syncing data or preferences, make sure you’re using the same account on both devices. Favorites and other data from your Microsoft work account won’t sync to your personal account.  
 You can see which Microsoft account is currently active by selecting the profile photo in the app's upper-left corner.
17. [Contact Microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus#) . If your Edge Favorites or other data has mysteriously disappeared, you can contact Microsoft directly and have them force the appropriate data to your device from their servers. Doing this can also be helpful if your saved passwords are no longer appearing as they should.
18. Try the website in another browser. While Edge is a modern browser that supports all major internet standards, it’s not uncommon to come across a website that won't display properly. The only solution for this is to use the website in a[different browser](https://www.lifewire.com/top-internet-browsers-4589106) .
19. [Reinstall Microsoft Edge](https://www.lifewire.com/uninstall-microsoft-edge-4156669) . We don't recommend doing this since the Windows version is heavily integrated into the operating system and could result in adverse effects, but it might be necessary if none of the above has helped.
