##  'Pok√©mon' Unite Gameplay Basics 

 While inspired by the main_Pok√©mon_ video game series,_Pok√©mon Unite_ features an entirely different play style and even ignores some basic lore, which can make the experience rather intimidating and confusing for both new and long-time fans.

 The 30 minutes or so of tutorials that you must play through when you first start_Pok√©mon Unite_ do explain a lot of the main gameplay concepts. However, they also throw so much information at you that it‚Äôs totally understandable if you‚Äôve forgotten most of what they cover.

 Here‚Äôs what you need to know to play_Pok√©mon Unite_ .  

1. Collect Aeos energy by defeating Pok√©mon. Every time you win a battle, your opponent will release Aeos energy orbs, which you can collect by touching them.

2. Deposit your collected Aeos energy at your opponent‚Äôs goals. You could collect 100 Aeos energy orbs, but none of them will count towards your team‚Äôs score until you place them in one of several goals on the opposite side of the map.  
 If you have Aeos orbs to deposit, the orange and purple Pok√©ball icon next to your attack icons will light up while you‚Äôre standing on a goal. Select that icon to charge it and deposit all of your orbs.

3. Attack wild Pok√©mon to level up. They release some Aeos energy, but you really want to defeat them to earn XP to level up.  
 Leveling up your Pok√©mon not only makes it stronger, but it can unlock more powerful attacks and even evolve it depending on its species.  
 All Eevee evolutions start matches as Eevee. Earn enough XP by fighting wild Pok√©mon to have them automatically evolve into the form you selected before the match.  
![Eevee and a wild Pokemon in Pokemon United.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/m-skRaiIpVM-TxSFBVAKyTKNXjQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-play-pokemon-united-06-015eb74ab53b4f16b35dd8ba63640c77.jpg)
4. Attack opponent Pok√©mon to steal their Aeos energy. You can tell an opponent Pok√©mon from a wild one by the team color icon in their health bar that displays the number of Aeos orbs they have. Defeat them Pok√©mon to take their Aeos energy, and then run to a goal to deposit it.  
![Two Pokemon fighting in Pokemon Unite.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/I2dAcqITvN0vCULSYfa_lO7PcY0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-play-pokemon-united-12-b35ba263963f40febbe5e750a6c8ab3e.jpg)
5. Ignore elemental type strengths and weaknesses from previous_Pok√©mon_ games. A Fire-type Pok√©mon may have been strong against a Grass-type in other games, but in_Pok√©mon Unite_ , it‚Äôs all about level, class type, and little else. Therefore, a strong Fire Pok√©mon can take down your Water Pok√©mon with just a few hits, so be careful.  
 Ignore traditional element types and choose your Pok√©mon based on the attack and defense styles that suit your play style.

6. Running low on health? Run back to one of the goals on your side of the board to heal.  
 Your opponents can also heal on their goals as well, so it‚Äôs best not to attack them if they‚Äôre standing on one because they'll heal as soon as you damage them. They aren't invincible, but they‚Äôll definitely be at an advantage.  
![Jigglypuff healing in a goal in Pokemon Unite.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RPZ866uDuAQ-GmYR7yGAwNjJGvU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-play-pokemon-united-11-6a571c9a6d694105aa68ebefbf6dffa0.jpg)
7. Certain wild Pok√©mon grant abilities and can win the match. It can be tempting to target your opponents once you‚Äôre strong enough but don‚Äôt ignore wild Pok√©mon, especially the larger ones, which can give you boosts, shields, and buffs.  
 If you‚Äôve gained a benefit after defeating a wild Pok√©mon, your Pok√©mon will have a colored aura.  
![Special Pokemon Ludicolo in Pokemon United.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZBI277ts83GYsSLGbPZyxl9z74Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-play-pokemon-united-08-eeb29ef01c6a46439e31a2c8e390be38.jpg)
8. Defeating Zapdos could win the match. During the final two minutes of the match, the legendary electric bird, Zapdos, will appear at the center of the map. Whoever performs the final hit on Zapdos before its defeat earns 30 Aeos, while everyone on their team receives 20 Aeos each.  
 These points could win your team the match even if you were falling way behind. It‚Äôs kind of like catching the Golden Snitch in Quidditch in the[ Harry Potter movies](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-harry-potter-movies-in-order-5084792) .  
 You still need to deposit the earned Aeos at a goal for them to count. Fortunately, this means that if your opponents defeat Zapdos, you have an opportunity to steal their Aeos before they turn them in.  
![Wigglytuff and Zapdos in Pokemon Unite.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vVO6pf-Ao83RsiMhuX2HZlexfus=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-play-pokemon-united-10-959df5b560804bb4a351b1389a95da62.jpg)
9. Check the Battle Prep menu in the lobby before the match starts. This screen will show you which path on the map is recommended for your Pok√©mon and will also let you customize your default attacks.  
 You can explore any part of the map during the match, but selecting a section will let the rest of your team know what area you‚Äôre planning to cover.

##  How to Get Coins in 'Pok√©mon Unite'

##  How to Block a Goal in 'Pok√©mon Unite' 

 The best way to block a goal is to attack your opponent while they‚Äôre depositing all of their Aeos energy. A powerful attack can knock them off of the goal, but usually, just the attack itself will motivate your opponent to move out of the way to safety.

![A springboard in Pokemon United with Leafeon.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dIVTs0b5qcfRZcxYNVkc976co10=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-play-pokemon-united-03-d1a1de6d05be483393c43d743dbdbb0a.jpg) 

 Another way to stop a player from depositing Aeos is to use a springboard to jump on top of them. Springboards look like gray metallic squares. Stand on one to activate it.  

##  How to Change Your Character's Gender in 'Pok√©mon Unite' 

 Unfortunately, it‚Äôs impossible to change your character‚Äôs gender in_Pok√©mon Unite_ , so make sure you select the option you want when you create your profile.

 One alternative is to change their clothes to make them look more like a different gender (or even gender ambiguous). Many players do this and end up creating some great looks.
