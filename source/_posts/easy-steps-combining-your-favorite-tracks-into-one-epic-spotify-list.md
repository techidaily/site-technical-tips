 Spotify's mobile app lets you merge two playlists by selecting each song one at a time, or you can copy an entire playlist into another playlist. Here's how to do both:
4. Tap**Your Library** at the bottom.

## Can You Add a Whole Playlist to Another Playlist on Spotify?  

 Spotify limits playlists to 10,000 songs, so as long as you don’t exceed that number, you should have no trouble copying an entire playlist into another one. Follow the instructions outlined above to do this on desktop or mobile.

 FAQ  

* How do I merge playlists on Spotify web player?  
    You can merge playlists in the Spotify web player the same way you can in the app. Select multiple tracks or locate the three-dot menu next to a singe song, then right-click it and select**Add to playlist** to see your options. The web version works best for playing existing playlists and[creating new Spotify playlists](https://www.lifewire.com/make-a-playlist-on-spotify-4138575) .  
* How do I merge Spotify playlists and remove duplicates?  
    Spotify will notify you if you're copying songs that already exist in the merged playlist. Select**Add new ones** on desktop or**Cancel** on mobile to avoid duplicate songs when combining lists.
