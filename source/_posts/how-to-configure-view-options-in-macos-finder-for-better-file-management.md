## Who Is Eligible for a YouTube Premium Student Discount?

 Students can sign up for a YouTube Music Premium or YouTube Premium membership at a discount. Students must be enrolled full-time at an eligible higher education institution in the U.S. and 60-plus other countries to qualify. The discounted subscriptions are valid for up to four years, and students must re-verify their eligibility each year. A company called SheerID does the verification.

## What Does the YouTube Premium Student Discount Include?

 Students get a 1-month free trial and pay about half of the monthly subscription amount. The membership includes the same benefits as a non-discounted membership. Members get access to both YouTube and YouTube Music Premium, ad-free videos and music, video and music downloads for offline viewing and listening, and the ability to play videos in the background while using other apps or when your screen is locked.

## What Happens When You Finish School?

 The YouTube Premium Student discount is only available if you attend an eligible school and is limited to four years total. Whichever comes first—graduation or four years in school—is when your discount expires.

 YouTube requires that you verify your student status once a year by repeating the process above. When you no longer qualify, you can opt to pay the full price for a premium account or cancel your subscription.
