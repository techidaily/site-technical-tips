4. For verification purposes, you may be asked to verify your identity by logging into your Facebook or X (formerly Twitter) account. If needed, tap**Verify and Continue** to move forward.
5. A confirmation screen will appear. If you wish to move forward with deleting your account, tap**Delete Account** .
