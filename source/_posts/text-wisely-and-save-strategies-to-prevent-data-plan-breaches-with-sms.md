## Text Wisely and Save: Strategies to Prevent Data Plan Breaches with SMS
 You can do more with texting (or SMS) than send brief messages to friends. If you pay for a text messaging plan or texting is included in your plan, you may not need the mobile web, which consists of browser-based internet services that are accessed from mobile devices such as smartphones, and affects data usage. Instead, use text messaging.

 Texting from a mobile phone is part of a cellular call system's[Short Message Service](https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-sms-text-messaging-578676) (SMS). Sending a text doesn't use data allowance, but unless SMS is included in a monthly plan, there may be a small fee for each text.

 What We Like

* Don't need an internet connection to update Facebook status.

 What We Don't Like

* Must set up Facebook texts and add a mobile phone number.

 If you’re part of the ​social-networking craze and[Facebook](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facebook-3486391) is in your repertoire, don't be tethered to your computer to update your status for friends and colleagues. Rather than access Facebook in a browser to post an update, post a status update by text. Sign up for the free Facebook texts service, and you're set.

 What We Like

* It's so easy!

 What We Don't Like

* Don't know if contests are legitimate or secure.

 Text messaging is one of the most popular ways to enter sweepstakes. You don’t have to be on a computer or use a smartphone's mobile web browser to enter sweepstakes. If you’re out and about and a contest strikes your fancy, text to enter. Some contests let you know within seconds if you’ve won.

 What We Like

* Fast and easy way to send a quick email.

 What We Don't Like

* Must know which carrier the text-email recipient uses.

 Even if neither you nor the person you're contacting has email configured on your mobile phone, your mobile phone has an email address that begins with the phone number.[Text to it from your phone](https://www.lifewire.com/sms-gateway-from-email-to-sms-text-message-2495456) just like you would send an email from your computer. You can also forward emails to the address.

 An email sent in a text message is split into several short texts.
