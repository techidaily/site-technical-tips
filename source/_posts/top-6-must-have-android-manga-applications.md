### Read Manga anywhere you want

If you are a super manga fan, I bet you must have purchased a lot of Manga books from Amazon/Kobo/Google Play/Nook book store, etc. However, most of the books comes with DRM. So you need to remove DRM from the manga books if you don't want to restricted to their supported devices or apps to read them. Sometimes you also need to convert the Manga format so that you can read them on other supported devices. Or you want to share this book with your friend. Truth be told, Calibre is a wonderful software for you to deal with these problems(**Note: Calibre can't deal with Kindle KFX format yet**). But Epubor Ultimate is way powerful and way easier to use than Calibre. No need to install plugin and intensive labor work. You can refer to [this guide to remove DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).
