### **Step 1: Turn off your laptop and the projector**

 Make sure your laptop and the projector are both turned off before you connect your laptop to the projector.

### **Step 2: Connect your laptop to the projector**

 Before connecting your laptop to the projector, you need to know what ports your laptop and the projector have.

1. Please ensure that the video port on your PC matches an available video port on the projector, like DisplayPort ( **DP** ), **HDMI** , **VGA,** and **DVI**  . If not, you may need a **video output adapter cable** to convert one type of video signal to another.

2. Connect your laptop to the projector firmly with a compatible video cable.

### **Step 3: Turn on the projector and your laptop**

 After connecting your laptop to the projector, turn on your laptop, and then press**the power button** to turn on the projector.

 Normally the projector will project the screen of your laptop. If not, make sure the signal source of the projector**is consistent with** the video output signal of your laptop.

 For example, if you connect your laptop to the projector using a VGA cable, then you should switch the signal source of the projector to**VGA**  or**Computer**  with the projector remote control; if you are using an HDMI cable to connect your laptop to the projector, then switch the signal source of the projector to **HDMI** .

 If you don’t know which key on the remote control you should press, please refer to the instruction manual of the projector remote control.

### **Step 4: Update your graphics driver to the latest version**

 It is important to ensure that your graphics driver has been updated to the latest version. If not, please update your graphics driver to ensure stability and the best performance.
