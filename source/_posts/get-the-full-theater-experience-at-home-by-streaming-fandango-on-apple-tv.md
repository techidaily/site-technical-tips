##  How to Start Watching Fandango at Home on Apple TV 

 To get started with Fandango at Home, you first need to[ download it from the App Store](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-apps-on-apple-tv-1999693) . Then, follow the on-screen instructions to sign in.

##  How to Rent and Buy Movies on Fandango at Home for Apple TV 

 While you can watch purchased or rented movies or TV shows using the Fandango at Home app, and you have access to the full Movies on Us free movie catalog, you can't rent or purchase movies using the Apple TV Fandango at Home app. You can add to your wishlist, but you'll have to go to the website to make the purchase.

 Apple charges a 30% commission for all in-app purchases, which includes digital media like music, books, and movies. Instead of passing this on to the customer, providers like Fandango at Home and Amazon disallow buying or renting in the app. Instead, you must make purchases on other devices directly from the Fandango at Home website.

 Once you buy or rent a Fandango at Home movie on another device, it should appear on your Apple TV in seconds.
