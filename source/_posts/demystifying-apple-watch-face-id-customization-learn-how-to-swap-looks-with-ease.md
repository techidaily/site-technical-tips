## Mastering Workflow on Mac with Monterey's Custom Focus Modes to Minimize Distractions

With Monterey, several very handy features were brought to life in macOS. One such feature that doesn't get nearly the attention it should is called Focus. With Focus, you define what notifications are shown when a particular Focus is active. Say, for example, you create a focus called Writing, where you require an absolute minimum amount of distractions. However, there is one particular contact (say your agent or your spouse) that you do want to allow as a distraction (for obvious reasons). With Focus, you can do just that -- create a focus that will only allow those notifications you specific to be able to interrupt your flow.

And we all know how important flow is. A few seconds of setback can take you minutes to recover from (especially when you're in the zone). 

So, how do you create this custom Flow? Let me show you. All you'll need to make this work is either a MacBook Pro/Air or an iMac running macOS Monterey or newer. With such a device at the ready, let's get our Focus on.

Click Add, and you're done. The new Focus will be enabled, and you can be sure that only the contacts you've allowed will be able to interrupt your work (at least via macOS).
