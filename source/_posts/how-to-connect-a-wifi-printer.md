_Skype can’t connect_

 Skype sure is making our lives so much easier. But there are times when you can’t connect to Skype, and you’re seeing the message saying**_Sorry, we couldn’t connect to Skype_** , you’re not alone. Many Windows 10 users are reporting this problem as well. But no worries, it’s possible to fix.

 Here are 4 fixes for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

 **Method 1:[Check Skype Heartbeat](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 2:[Upgrade Skype to the latest version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 3:[Check for Available Windows Update](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 4:[Refresh Network Settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 5:[Update Network Card Driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Check Skype Heartbeat

 3) If you do see message concerning connection problem, all you can do is to wait for Skype technicians to solve it on their end.

## 2\. Upgrade Skype to the latest version
