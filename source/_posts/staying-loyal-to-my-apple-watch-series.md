## Stay Connected: Using Your Apple Watch to Keep Up with Loved Ones - Tips

![Using Check In on an iPhone with iOS 18](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/9b0468f5b1ab76187ca9c7ddabd9ce874b1968e6/2024/09/19/f0a9dd03-a014-41af-b177-fa1ba405e22a/figure-top-how-to-check-in-with-a-friend-or-family-member-from-your-apple-watch.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

I sometimes want to check in with my wife to let her know where I am or how I'm doing. Sure, I can always call or text her at specific moments. But maybe I'm driving or working out at the gym or otherwise occupied and would like her to automatically receive a text at a certain point. With an Apple Watch running watchOS 11, I can do just that.

**Also: [The best Apple Watches: Expert tested and reviewed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/)**

New with the latest version of watchOS is a feature called Check In. Accessible from the Messages app and the Workout app, Check In alerts someone if you've reached a specific destination based on your arrival time or location. Plus, if you've finished a workout and want to let someone know, Check In will notify that person. Here's how this works.

## How to check in with a friend or family member from your Apple Watch

**What you'll need**: To use Check In, you have to be running watchOS 11 or higher on your Apple Watch, which requires iOS 18 or higher on your iPhone. [These Apple Watch models](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-apple-watch-that-will-get-watchos-11-and-which-models-wont-be-supported/) can run watchOS 11.

## 1\. Update your devices

To update your phone to iOS 18, head to Settings, select General, and then choose the option to upgrade to iOS 18\. Tap the Update Now button and allow the latest version to be downloaded and installed.

To update watchOS, open the Watch app on your iPhone. Go to General, select Software Update, and let the latest version download and install. You can also run the update directly from your watch. For this, open the Settings app, select General, tap Software Update, and let the update install.

## 2\. Send the default Check In through the Messages app

Launch the Messages app on your Apple Watch. Start or continue a conversation with a trusted family member or friend. Tap the + icon to the left of the iMessage field. From the menu, select Check In. By default, the Check In screen will indicate a specific destination, such as home or work, and the estimated time of arrival from your current location. The feature will use a timer to determine how long it will take you to reach the destination. If you wish to share that information as is with the other person, tap Send.

## 3\. View the initial Check In notification

The recipient receives a notification alerting them that you sent them a Check In with a specific time. After tapping OK, the recipient is asked if they want to allow critical alerts, which they should do. A text message then displays the time when they'll receive the alert that you reached your destination.

## 4\. View the actual Check in alert

When the timer is up to indicate that you should have reached your destination, you'll be prompted to stop the Check In to confirm that you've arrived. You can add more time or cancel the Check In. Otherwise, the recipient will receive your Check In notification. If the confirmation isn't sent, more time will be added. After that, the recipient will be informed that you haven't yet checked in. They can then try to contact you by text or phone call to find out why you haven't yet arrived.

## 5\. Change the time for a Check In

If you don't want to share the default details with a Check In, you can easily change them. After starting or resuming a conversation in Messages with your trusted contact, tap the + icon and select Check In. At the Check In screen, tap Edit. The next screen displays several settings that you can modify.

If you still wish to use a timer for the Check In option but change the amount of time allocated, tap Timer. Tap the button for hours and use the Digital Crown to cycle through different numbers. Do the same for the number of minutes. When finished, tap Done. Tap the yellow checkmark and then send the text. When you end the Check In at the appropriate time, your recipient will be alerted as an indication that you've arrived.

## 6\. Send a customized Check In through the Messages app

To further customize the Check In, tap the Edit button at the Check In screen. Tap Check In. You can now set a notification to be sent when you've arrived at your destination, after the timer ends, or when a workout ends. Tap the option for "When I arrive."

## 7\. Add a destination and send the text

Next, tap the link for "Add a Destination." Start typing the address of the destination. Select the full name when it appears on the screen. Swipe down the Check In screen and select or confirm your mode of transportation -- driving, transit, or walking. Swipe down further. Tap the link for "Add Extra Time" if you need to add more time. When done, tap the yellow checkmark at the top and then tap Send to send the text. Your recipient will then receive the notification when you reach your destination and stop the Check In.
