##  Why Is My Apple Watch Not Registering When I Stand? 

 There are many different reasons why your Apple Watch isn't registering you standing. It's important to troubleshoot why it occurs to figure out how to fix the issue. Typically, the reason is often quite simple.  

* **You're not standing for long enough** : The Stand feature only recognizes when you've been standing for one minute. It won't detect it if you stand up for a brief length of time.
* **You're not moving your arms sufficiently** : The Apple Watch uses an accelerometer to track your movement. If you're standing for a minute but not moving your arms, it may not notice you've moved. Move your arms around to ensure it recognizes your efforts.
* **Your Apple Watch needs updating** : Sometimes, an old update can affect how well your Apple Watch works. Update your Apple Watch to the latest software to try to fix the issue.
* **Your Apple Watch needs calibrating** : Open the Workout app, select Outdoor Walk, and go for a walk for about 20 minutes to calibrate your Apple Watch to reset most tracking.

##  How Long Do You Have to Stand for Apple Watch to Register? 

 You need to be standing for at least a minute for your Apple Watch to register your activity.   

 That minute needs to involve you using your arms by moving them around in some way so that the device recognizes your movements. Standing very still rarely works.

##  Can You Manually Add Stand Hours on Apple Watch? 

 No. It's not currently possible to manually add stand hours to your Apple Watch as it means people could "cheat" the system and fake their progress.

 It's also impossible to change how often it reminds you to stand, with the set number being once every hour as recommended by many health professionals.
