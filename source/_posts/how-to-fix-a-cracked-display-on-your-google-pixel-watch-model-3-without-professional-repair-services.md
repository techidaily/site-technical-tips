## How to Fix a Cracked Display on Your Google Pixel Watch Model 3 Without Professional Repair Services

Google has confirmed that its new Pixel Watch 3 will not be repairable, and can only be exchanged for a new unit if it breaks under warranty. That's the same policy as the first two models.

 It doesn't matter if your Watch screen has cracked or the battery has inexplicably died, Google will not repair the unit. "If your device is damaged, you can contact the Google Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your replacement options," a Google spokesperson told _Android Authority_.

 If the Watch is still under warranty, Google will replace it at no charge. If you've subscribed to Google's "Preferred Care" extended warranty program (which costs $4/month or $89 for two years), Google will provide a replacement Watch after you pay a $49 "service fee." Should your Watch break a few years down the line when its warranty has expired, Google will not replace the unit, but will be willing to sell you a new one at a discount, though those units won't come with charging cables or bands.

 The [Pixel Watch 3 debuted in August](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-6-effortless-steps-to-add-social-media-live-content-online/) at the company's Made by Google event. It's offered in both 41mm and 45mm screen sizes, can brighten up to 2,000 nits (double that of the Watch 2), and can dynamically modulate its refresh rate as high as 60Hz. Designed with runners in mind, the Watch 3 is outfitted with a wide variety of biometric analyzers including heart rate, oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram, skin conductance and temperature sensors, all of which work together to help folks train and recover more efficiently.

 The watch can help you create tailored running routines including interval training, timed warm-ups and cool downs, as well as set a target pace, heart rate, time, or distance for your day's run. While on the run, the Watch can provide active feedback about your session through audio and haptic signals, critiquing your cadence and stride length. If you opt for the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription, you can leverage Google's Gemini AI to dig through your workout and recovery data to provide personalized insights into your training regimen and suggest improvements.

 The Pixel Watch 3 will start at $349.99 for the 41mm Bluetooth/Wi-Fi model, and $449.99 for the 41mm LTE model. The 45mm version with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi will set you back $399.99, while the LTE variant costs $499.99\. The Watch 3 is expected to begin shipping on September 10.
