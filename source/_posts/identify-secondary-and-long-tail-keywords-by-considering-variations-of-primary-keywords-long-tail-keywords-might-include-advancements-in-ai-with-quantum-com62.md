2. Make sure the device is properly connected.  
 If it's inside the PC, check to make sure all the connections are firmly seated and any connectors are properly connected. If this is a newly installed device, check the manual to make sure everything is connected in the correct fashion to the appropriate connectors on the motherboard. For external devices (i.e., connected with a USB cable), try using a different cable.
3. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If the device was previously working, undo any recent changes to the Device Manager by using [System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) .

4. [Roll back your drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) . If the code 41 error began after updating a particular hardware device, reverting to an older driver version of that driver should help.

 This isn't the same as updating a driver. A full driver reinstall involves completely removing the currently installed driver and then letting Windows install it over again from scratch.
7. Delete corrupt registry values. A common cause of code 41 errors is the corruption of two[registry values](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-value-2626042) . Go into the[Windows Registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) and[delete the UpperFilters and LowerFilters registry values](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-the-upperfilters-and-lowerfilters-registry-values-2619222) .

## Causes of Code 41 Errors

 Error code 41 is one of several[Device Manager error codes](https://www.lifewire.com/device-manager-error-codes-4159098) . It's caused either by a [hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) device that's been removed after the [driver](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) was loaded or by an issue with the device driver itself.

 Instructions in this article apply to all Microsoft [operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , including[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) , [Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) , [Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) , [Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) , [Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) , and[Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) .
