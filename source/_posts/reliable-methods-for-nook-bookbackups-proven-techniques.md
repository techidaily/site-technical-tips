As what the image shows that, B&N has started sending out emails to customers that they will cut off the supporting the 1st generation Nook as of June 29\. What does this mean? You won't be able to buy books from B&N any longer on your first generation Nook device! I've paid money for the device and contents why I don't have the right to control them? You may feel angry like me but here I want to let your know that the perfect solution for this is to back up Nook books!

![backup Nook books](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/backup-nook-books.jpg)

Except Amazon and Kobo eBook stores, Barnes & Noble is also one of the popular eBook retailers on the market. If you are a big fan of Nook books, I guess you must have got a lot of Nook books at hand. When reading these purchased or downloaded Nook files, have you ever thought about the safety of them? Are you worried about that your Nook books will disappear someday? And you cannot redownload and open them at all? In fact, we cannot guarantee the downloaded Nook files are 100% safe, Nook may delete our Nook content without any explanation. But what can we do to ensure we won't lose them forever? Obviously, the best way is to backup Nook books and save a copy of them on our computer.

### The necessity to backup Nook books

Why we need to backup Nook books? As I have mentioned, our purchased Nook files are not completely safe, like Amazon or Kobo eBook store, Nook files are also saved in "Cloud" server of Barnes & Noble. How can we make sure it won't have any problem? Or it won't delete our Nook content without any notice just like the true story that Amazon deleted one of its user's books without saying a word? To protect our downloaded Nook files, it's essential to backup Nook content. 

Besides, we cannot guarantee Nook eBook store will be running in a good condition forever, backup Nook files is a wise choice in case of Barnes & Noble will close down some day.

### How to backup Nook books

It's not hard for us to find out that most of downloaded Nook files are DRM protected. How to backup Nook books? You may said I can sync them via Nook app, then copy them to another folder of my disk. But if Nook have deleted your Nook content, when you tried to open the stored file, you may cannot open it at all as Nook tells the server you are not the owner of the book. Because of DRM, it's impossible for you to view the saved Nook files. So removing DRM and make a copy of DRM free eBooks to your computer is the best way to backup Nook files.

Thus, an eBook DRM removal tool is needed. Here I recommend the professional Nook decryption tool [Epubor Nook Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/nook-converter/) for you. It's an all-in-one eBook tool, which contains both DRM removal and eBook conversion functions. As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the most powerful and handy tool I have used.

Could you send "step by step" instructions on how to accomplish moving Nook Books to a laptop. Also is it possible to move the "nook" files to an external hard drive and use the external hard drive as a library? And is it possible to continue purchasing from Nook and transferring to the external hard drive. Can a device be interfaced to the hard drive to bring up a certain selection?   
 I ask these questions as one who is not technically savvy at these things do any help will be greatly appreciated.  
 Also do you have info on how to setup an online radio station or podcast ?  
 Thanks in advance.  
 I may have more questions in the future

I keep seeing posts where you say to download nook books with the Windows Nook for PC app but HOW do you do that? When I download them into my app and then sync, they are still not on my hard drive. How do you get them from the app to the hard drive? Thanks.

BN has as of may - June 2019 further encrypted their books and have apparently created a data base you cannot decrypt.  
 are you familiar with this process? do you have any solutions to allow us to download nook books?

Thank you for asking. Yes, the Nook has changed its DRM scheme and there is not solution for now. But we are working on this issue. Once we have cracked this new DRM, we will add this feature to our Epubor Ultimate. Have a nice day!

I'm trying to use it for transferring Nook books to Kindle. When I follow the directions, Nook does not even come up as an option to enter my credentials. Has it been removed from the tool?

Thank you for using Epubor software. Yes, the Nook tab has been removed because the Nook books have been encrypted with new DRM scheme. This is no way to crack it for now. We are sincerely sorry for this issue, but our team is working on this new DRM. Once this DRM has been cracked, we will let you know, ok?

How about transferring nook via epubor to a MAC laptop? We are looking at your website and donâ€™t see them mention Nook at all.

Thank you for asking. To remove nook drm, you need to download nook books to windows via nook windows app (from microsoft store), then remove drm with Epubor Ultimate. For the details, you can contact support@epubor.com to request the nook key.

 Have a nice day.

Thank you so much. This worked great. Very greateful I can now back up my nook books. I have 2 nooks 2 kindles an LG phone and an HP laptop. I mostly read on my phone because its always with me and its lightweight. I read most books on my Play Books app. Always concerned about my Kindle and Nook books being lost because of app store closing or software updates. It pisses me off to no end that a book I purchase from Amazon is still under their control and not really mine to do with as I choose. Thanks again and keep up the great work &lt;3

Sure wish I could try out your tools for freeing my Nook books. I have Windows 10 (64-bit, version 20H2). I'm logged into the Nook app and can see all my purchased books. But I can't download them to my laptop. The download is stuck on 0%. My info is all updated in my B&N account, I've deleted and reentered my CC info. Nothing is blocked by my security software. Yet I still can't download my books to my computer. Sigh. But anyway, thanks for the nice tutorials and walk-throughs!

Followed the instructions. Bought the Nook Convertor and copied all my books over to my computer and Kindle. Cleared the DRM hurdle. I don't want to buy another nook and the BN Nook App doesn't work on my Kindle.
