## Is There a Google Hangouts Replacement?

 Google has other similar services like[Google Chat](https://chat.google.com/) and Google Voice. Both are free and share lots of the same features as Google Hangouts. You can make free calls to any phone with Voice and text with other Google users with Chat. There's also[Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) for one-on-one or group meetings.

 If you want to move away from Google's options, countless apps serve as a great Google Hangouts alternative.[Facebook Messenger](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-messenger-4103719) and[Snapchat](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-snapchat-3485908) are well-known messaging and calling apps, but there are plenty of other options.
