## Troubleshooting the Missing mfc42d.dll Error on Your PC - Easy Fixes Inside
 Mfc42d.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the mfc42d[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) , which is the debug version of[mfc42.dll](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-mfc42-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623635) .  
  
 This error could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's[operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , including[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) ,[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) , etc.

## How to Fix Mfc42d.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download mfc42d.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore mfc42d.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" mfc42d.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free data recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete this step, or any of the following steps, if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 6 to safely download mfc42d.dll.  
 If the file is copied to the correct location to fix the error,[copy the file](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-copy-a-file-in-windows-2619210) to wherever the DLL error message says it's missing from.
3. [Reinstall the program that uses the mfc42d.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.
4. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some mfc42d.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
5. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
6. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to mfc42d.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file mfc42d.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 The mfc42d.dll file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
7. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if mfc42d.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
8. [Run the sfc /scannow System File Checker command](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161) to replace a missing or corrupt copy of the mfc42d.dll file. If this DLL file is provided by Microsoft, the[System File Checker](https://www.lifewire.com/sfc-command-system-file-checker-2626020) tool should restore it.
9. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other[patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The mfc42d.dll file could be included in one of those updates.
10. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause mfc42d.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
11. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual mfc42d.dll file troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
12. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair mfc42d.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid mfc42d.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. They've been included as an option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
13. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the mfc42d.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the mfc42d.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
14. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any mfc42d.dll errors persist. After a clean Windows installation, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.
