## Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Specs and Hardware

 The first thing to note about the Z Flip 6 is the screen.

 We thought the cover display (the one you see when it's closed) would see an upgrade, but that isn't the case. This one is the same size–3.4 inches–as its predecessor. The resolution is also the same: 720 x 748 pixels. The main display is also the same size (6.7 inches) and resolution (1080 x 2640 pixels).

 Similarly, the case is the same size, but it and the screens will still use Armor Aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus 2, respectively. Samsung has also strengthened the hinge and folding point of the screen, which it says offers more protection from drops and impacts.

 As for colors, the Z Flip 6 is available in more options than the Flip 5\. Here are the selections:

* Blue
* Crafted Black
* Mint (green) – Samsung website exclusive
* Peach
* Silver Shadow
* White
* Yellow

 The rear camera also got a bump in this version. The Z Flip 5 includes a 10 MP front camera and 12 MP wide and ultrawide rear lenses. The Z Flip 6 has a comparable front option, but the back includes a 12 MP ultra-wide camera and an impressive 50 MP wide option.  

 As we'd heard, the Z Flip 6 also has a bigger battery than the Flip 5, which had a 3,700mAh cell. The Flip 6 bumps it up to 4,000mAh, which helps it manage the increased load of artificial intelligence features.

 AI also needs additional memory, and the Z Flip 6 has more of that, too. It has 12GB of RAM, compared to the Flip 5's 8GB. As we said, it also has storage options of 256GB and 512GB.

 Finally, the chip running the Flip 6 is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy processor (the Flip 5 uses the Gen 2). This upgrade may translate to things like increased battery efficiency, smoother multitasking, faster app loading times, and, of course, more processing power for Samsung AI.

## Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Features

 Speaking of AI, Samsung has touted several of the Z Flip 6's "smart" features. You have access to some on the cover display, including text message generation, health updates, and additional widgets.

 The Z Flip 6 also includes some of the features Samsung has been talking about for a while, including[Google Gemini](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-bard-7151624) integration. This platform provides things like real-time translation, photo analysis, and automatic captioning on videos and calls.

 "Photo Ambient" is another AI feature, which lets you make a wallpaper that updates through the day or as the weather changes. It will also suggest screen layouts based on your background image.

Samsung

 Auto Zoom aims to help you take the most interesting pictures possible by analyzing the subject and automatically framing it. This feature works without you having to touch anything.

 The cameras also use AI to provide up to 10x zoom and take better low-light shots and videos. Integration with apps like Instagram is built in so you can use these features directly in Stories and other posts.
