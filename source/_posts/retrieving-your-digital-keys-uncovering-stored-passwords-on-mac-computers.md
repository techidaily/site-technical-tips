### What to Know

 This article explains how to find passwords saved on a Mac. Saving passwords is useful, especially if you use[very long, very safe passwords](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-create-a-strong-password-4783955) , but sometimes you'll forget them.

## How Do I View Saved Passwords on My Mac?

 Follow these instructions to view saved passwords on your Mac:

1. Open a new**Finder** window and go to**Applications** \>**Utilities** .

2. Open**Keychain Access** .
3. In the search bar in the top right corner, search for the password you're looking for. It's best to search for the name of the website or app whose password you want to see.

4. When you find the password, view it with a double-click.
5. Check the box next to**Show Password** .

6. In the pop-up window, enter the password you use when logging onto your computer and click**Allow** for one-time access (or**Always Allow** for longer-term access).  
 For some passwords, just click**OK** instead.
7. The password appears in the**Password** field at the bottom of the pop-up window.

## What Is Keychain Access?

 Keychain Access comes pre-installed on all Macs and is Apple's tool to save passwords. It saves usernames and passwords for Safari, Wi-Fi networks, and apps. It's Keychain Access that auto-fills your account info when you need to log in.

 Because Keychain Access stores all of your passwords, it's also the place where you view saved passwords on your Mac. We'll assume you have some passwords in Keychain Access already, so follow these steps to look them up.

 Keychain Access isn't the only[password manager](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-password-managers-work-5186454) out there. Others (1Password is may be the most well-known) work in basically the same way. The exact steps differ based on the program you use, but you can look up passwords in those programs, too.

## How to Sync Saved Passwords With iCloud Keychain

 Like the idea of saving your passwords and having them autofill when you need them? Not only can you do so on a Mac, but it works on iPhone and iPad, too. That feature is called[iCloud Keychain](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-set-up-use-icloud-keychain-4797068) and it works just like other parts of iCloud: content is synced to all devices logged into the same iCloud account. So, if you set up iCloud Keychain on all your devices, they'll all have the same passwords. To do so, follow these steps.

* **On Mac** : Go to**Apple** menu >**System Preferences** \>**Apple ID** \>**iCloud** \> check the box next to**Keychain** .
* **On iPhone or iPad** : Go to**Settings** \> \[your name\] >**iCloud** \>**Keychain** \> move the**iCloud Keychain** slider to on/green.

## How Do I View Saved Passwords in Chrome?

 Chrome is many people's preferred browser, but it doesn't work with Keychain (by default, at least; there's a[browser extension to make Keychain compatible with Chrome](https://www.lifewire.com/access-icloud-keychain-passwords-on-chrome-for-windows-5113109) ). Instead, Chrome saves passwords itself. Here's how to look up passwords in Chrome on a Mac.

1. Open Chrome >**Chrome** menu >**Preferences** \>**Autofill** \>**Passwords** .  
![Chrome settings window with Preferences, Autofill, and Passwords highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mdZ6vJexnIuYHCd79cqgjSNkfjk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ChromePasswords-7c066fac14704110952b1602f27b41ac.jpg)
2. Scroll down to the**Saved Passwords** section.

3. Click the**eye** icon next to the account whose password you want to view.
4. In the pop-up window, enter the password you use to log onto the computer and click**OK** .
5. The password appears in the**Password** column.
