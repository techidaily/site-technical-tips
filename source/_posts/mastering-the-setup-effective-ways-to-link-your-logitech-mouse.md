## How to Pair a Logitech Wireless Mouse With Your PC

 Unpack the Logitech mouse from its box and insert a battery into the mouse. Always make sure you align the batteries in the right direction. Misalignment with the positive and negative contacts is a simple mistake.

1. The mouse comes with a small Bluetooth receiver. Take the USB receiver and plug it into one of your computer’s open USB slots.

## Can I Pair Logitech Mouse With Another Receiver?

 A Logitech wireless mouse can pair with one receiver at a time. So, you cannot pair a Logitech wireless mouse with another receiver if you lose one of these tiny plugs. But there are two workarounds offered by Logitech if you lose the original receiver.

### Use the Logitech Unifying Software

 Purchase the[Unifying USB receiver](https://secure.logitech.com/en-in/resource-center/what-is-unifying.html) from Logitech. The dongle gives you the benefit of connecting six wireless devices to one receiver. The wireless devices from Logitech should support the Unifying technology. Look for the orange Unifying logo.

 Do note that a mouse works with one receiver at a time. So, it will no longer work with its original receiver if you pair it with a Logitech Unifying receiver.

## Bluetooth vs. Wireless Mice

 A Bluetooth mouse and a wireless mouse are both “wireless.” But they differ in the way they connect with the computer. A wireless mouse uses a dedicated receiver that plugs into the USB port on the computer, while a Bluetooth mouse uses the computer's Bluetooth antenna to pair with the mouse.

 FAQ

* How do I enable pairing mode on my mouse?  
 Locate the Bluetooth pairing button on your mouse, which is typically a toggle button on the bottom of the device. Turn the switch on and make sure the mouse is on before pairing with a compatible computer or another device.
* Why won't my Logitech mouse connect?  
 On Bluetooth mice, make sure the device and Bluetooth pairing modes are on. Try disabling and enabling Bluetooth on your mouse and computer to see if that clears up the issue. If your device uses a Unifying Receiver and the Unifying Receiver Software can't find your mouse, turn it off and on again to restart the receiver pairing process.
