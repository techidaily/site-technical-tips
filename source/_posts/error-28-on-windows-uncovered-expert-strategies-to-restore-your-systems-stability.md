## Android Blackout? Here's How to Restore Your Device's Visibility
 A blank phone screen is a very specific problem. This guide covers solutions for when you're having issues like these:

* You can use the buttons and hear or feel the appropriate responses, but there's a black screen.
* The phone rings or makes sounds for notifications, but you can't interact with the phone.
* Exterior lights flash and blink appropriately, but the screen doesn't work.

## What Causes an Android Black Screen?

 Unfortunately, there's no single reason why an Android phone screen is blank. Here are a few common situations that cause it, but there could be others:

* The screen's LCD connectors are loose
* There is a critical system error
* You've installed incompatible apps
* The phone overcharged for a long period
* App caches need to be cleared
* The phone has been exposed to extreme heat (such as leaving it in a hot car)

## How to Fix a Black Screen on an Android Phone

 Hold off on[buying a new phone](https://www.lifewire.com/best-places-to-buy-cell-phones-580000) ... for now. There are a few things you can try to get your Android working again when the phone screen goes black:

1. **Make sure the buttons on your device are not jammed** . Check for dirt, lotion, lint, and other debris. To free them so you can power on your phone, press them several times in quick succession. Buttons should freely depress with each press.  
 After you've thoroughly cleaned and tested the buttons,[reboot your Android device](https://www.lifewire.com/reboot-android-smartphone-or-tablet-4127180) .  
 These first few fixes are for when your phone screen is black because it's powered off.
2. **Clean the charging port** . Dust and debris could keep your phone from charging properly, so you'll see a blank screen until it's powered up enough to turn on.  
 Inspect and clean the charging port. If necessary you can gently blow into the port or use a wooden toothpick to dislodge anything stuck inside. Once it's clean, plug your phone in and let it charge for about 10 minutes. After it's charged for a short while, try restarting the phone.
3. **Recharge the battery** . Wait until the batteries die completely and the phone shuts down and then recharge the phone, and restart it after it's fully charged. If there is a critical system error causing the black screen, this should get your phone working again.
4. **Squeeze your phone** . Gently, but firmly press your phone from both sides, squeezing the front and back together. If there's a loose connection between the screen and motherboard, this could help reseat the connection and get the screen working again. If this works, consider taking the phone to an authorized service center to have them firmly reseat the internal cabling.  
 If your phone is in a case, remove it from the case before you start this process so that you can accurately gauge how much pressure to put on your phone without breaking the screen.
5. **Force restart the phone** . Plug in your phone, wait five minutes, and then try to do a forced restart. Depending on the model Android phone you have you may need to use some combination of buttons.  
 Try these:  
   * Press & hold the**Home** ,**Power** , &**Volume Down/Up** buttons.  
   * Press & hold the**Home** &**Power** buttons.  
   * Press & hold the**Power/Bixby** button until the phone shuts down completely.  
 Remember to restart your phone after it has completely shut down.
6. **Remove the battery** . If possible (not all phones have easily removable batteries), remove the battery, wait 30 seconds or more, and then reinstall the battery and start your phone.  
 If you can't remove the battery, you'll need to allow your phone to discharge completely. Then recharge it and try to restart the phone again.  
 Use caution when taking your phone apart to remove the battery. If you have a newer phone that's hard to open with the appropriate tools, take the device to a professional who can help. Otherwise, you run the risk of further damaging your phone.
7. **Remove the stylus** . If you have a Galaxy Note, for example, remove the S Pen and then put it right back to see if this causes the screen to come on.
8. [Reboot your phone into Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/android-safe-mode-4158035) . Press and hold the**Power** button for about 10 seconds, then press and hold the**Volume Down** button until you boot into Safe Mode.  
 If this works, you'll be able to navigate the phone to restart it, clear the cache (more on that below), or perform other tasks that could help fix the black screen problem.
9. [Clear the cache on your Android phone](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-cache-android-4157780) . This deletes temporary files and frees resources, which could resolve whatever issue is preventing the display from turning on.
10. [Factory reset the phone](https://www.lifewire.com/reset-android-smartphone-tablet-4129141) . This will restore the phone to its original settings, deleting all your data and returning the phone to its factory default settings.  
 If you have a Samsung phone, use[Samsung Smart Switch](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-smart-switch-4154655) to connect your phone to your computer, and then try to access it, reboot it, or back it up from there.
11. **Replace the screen** . There are DIY guides for this but more often than not, it's easier and quicker to just take your phone to someone qualified to fix it. If you're under warranty, contact the manufacturer.  
 The screen is only the issue if the phone works otherwise, like if it's still producing sound. If nothing works, a repair technician might chalk it up to a failed motherboard.

 If none of these steps have worked, it might be time to replace your phone. If you're looking to exit the Android space, check out this piece on[how iPhone and Android differ](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-vs-android-best-smartphone-2000309) if you're looking to jump ship.
