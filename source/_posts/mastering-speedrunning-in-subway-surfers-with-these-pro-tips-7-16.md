##  Experiment With Different Hoverboards

![Three images of Subway Surfers showing different hoverboards.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZaLI3eKm4Pach4jzsrPSDUDcoI8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/top-10-tips-and-tricks-for-subway-surfers-01-c343082163cb48cf980e02d62069acb9.jpg) 

 While the default[ hoverboard in Subway Surfers](https://www.lifewire.com/use-the-hoverboard-in-subway-surfers-8600031) is totally fine for racking up points and collecting items, enabling some of the boards with special abilities can really take your gameplay to the next level.

 Some boards, such as the Trickster, let you Super Jump higher than usual. Another, the Mag-Neat-O board, has the Zap Sideways special power, which lets you teleport left and right almost immediately.

 Here are the five different special powers that boards can have:

* **Double Jump** : Tap a second time to jump again in mid-air.
* **Smooth Drift** : You'll float down slowly when jumping rather than fall (kind of like Peach in the[ Super Mario games](https://www.lifewire.com/history-of-nintendo-729734) ).
* **Speed Up** : Faster than the average hoverboard.
* **Stay Low** : You'll slide under obstacles.
* **Zap Sideways** : You instantly teleport to a new "lane" when you swipe right and left.

 Each hoverboard’s special power appears under its name in orange text. If no power is listed, it’s just a regular board with a different look.

##  Skip the Ads and Still Get the Rewards

![Three images of in-app mobile ads with the close and skip icons highlighted.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z-lWmcEJz7oehEMdHrh8SsogOIY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/top-10-tips-and-tricks-for-subway-surfers-02-84bfea663ac24621872ca260bba1351d.jpg) 

 Watching the ads sprinkled throughout the menus in_Subway Surfers_ is a great way to unlock items,[ such as keys](https://www.lifewire.com/get-keys-in-subway-surfers-8558895) , for free, but it can be rather time-consuming.

 Fortunately, you can close some of the longer ads by tapping on the close or skip icon that appears before the ad finishes playing. These icons usually look like an x or an arrow in the upper right or left corners of the screen.  

 Don’t tap on the main area of the ad, as this can often take you to a website or even an app installation page.

##  Save Your Keys for Special Items

![Two images of Subway Surfers showing key items.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BKpeUWcxBGrpR-SDXBJbunuhlFA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/top-10-tips-and-tricks-for-subway-surfers-03-8b28ed2eebd542648e3fd7a54c9dd90f.jpg) 

 One of the best tricks for_Subway Surfers_ is to simply be a smart shopper. It can be tempting to use your keys to continue a level, but it’s best to save them up so that you can unlock rare characters and hoverboards.

 Some_Subway Surfers_ characters and items can only be bought by redeeming keys, so if you want to get every item in the game, saving these items is a must.
